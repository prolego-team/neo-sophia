SUBJECT: General Safety Regulations Summary

Dear Team,

Following the FIA regulations, this memo details the guidelines we need to strictly adhere to, ensuring driversâ€™ safety and the integrity of our splendid sport. Understanding and compliance with these rules are of utmost importance.

1. Instructions to drivers will be provided officially with signals outlined in the FIA Code. Flags or lights mimicking these signals must not be used [26.1].

2. The pit lane and track discipline and safety measures apply uniformly across all practice sessions, qualifying sessions and races unless specifically noted otherwise in the Sporting Regulations [26.2].

3. Any attempts to change the track surface grip, excluding driving on the track itself, is strictly forbidden [26.3].

4. The safety marshals are responsible for prompt removal of any stopped car on the track that could pose a risk or an obstacle to others. Stopping on track without justifiable reason could lead to disqualification [26.4].

5. A driver leaving a car must ensure it is in neutral/with the clutch disengaged, ERS shutdown, and the steering wheel in place. The car may not be touched by anyone except the driver unless in designated areas [26.5, 26.6].

6. From fifteen minutes before to five minutes after each session, and between formation lap commencement and last car parc ferme entry, no one, except authorised personnel, is allowed on track, pit entry, or pit exit [26.7].

7. During races and sprint sessions, the engine can only be started with the starter unless in the pit lane or designated garage area [26.8].

8. At all times throughout official practices, qualifying, and races, drivers must wear the standard specified protective gear [26.9].

9. A driver encountering significant mechanical issues should vacate the track as soon it is safe [26.10].

10. When using intermediate or wet-weather tyres, the lights described in Article 14.3 of the Technical Regulations must always be illuminated [26.11].

11. During each session, only twelve team members per Competitor are allowed within a signalling area [26.12].

12. Unless FIA authorised, anyone under 16 is not allowed in the pit lane during specified periods [26.13].

13. Any time during a Competition, drivers may be requested for a medical examination by authorised officials [26.14].

14. For each Competitor, the organiser has to provide at least two functioning fire extinguishers of 5kg capacity [26.15].

15. Except for security service animals authorised by the FIA, no animals are allowed on the track, pit lane, paddocks or spectator areas [26.16].

16. Outside the allowances stipulated in Articles 57 and 58, tyre blankets are not permitted in the Pit Lane [26.17]. 

17. During non-suspension periods, any car abandoned on the course by its driver is considered withdrawn from the session [26.18].

Adherence to these regulations and ensuring the safety of everyone involved in the sport is essential. A culture of compliance strengthens our team and upholds the spirit of the competition.
