SUBJECT: FIA Rule Clarification – INCIDENTS DURING THE SPRINT SESSION OR THE RACE (Article 54)

Dear Team,

In a bid to ensure we maintain full compliance with the FIA regulations, this memo seeks to clarify the rules as detailed in Article 54: 'Incidents during the Sprint Session or the Race'.

1. ON-TRACK INCIDENT REPORTING AND INVESTIGATION [54.1, 54.2]: The Race Director can report on-track incidents or suspected breaches to the stewards who will then decide whether an investigation is needed. The role of determining penalties for any driver involved in an incident is at the stewards’ discretion [54.1]. In cases where any driver(s) are under investigation, an official message will be dispatched to all Competitors, and those drivers may not leave the circuit without the stewards' consent [54.2b-i].

2. POTENTIAL PENALTIES FOR INCIDENTS [54.3]: The stewards can impose a variety of penalties for those found to be involved in incidents including 5 or 10-second time penalties [54.3a-b], a drive-through penalty [54.3c], a ten-second stop-and-go penalty [54.3d], time penalty in general [54.3e], a reprimand [54.3f], a grid position drop in the driver’s next race [54.3g], disqualification from the results [54.3h], and suspension from the next competition [54.3i]. In the case of the last 3 laps or post-race incidents, time will be added instead of the initial penalties in most cases [54.3]. Note, penalties under Article 54.3 can't be appealed.

3. PENALTY PROCEDURES [54.4]: Once a penalty under Articles 54.3a-d is imposed, all competitors will be officially notified [54.4a]. For everything except 54.3a and 54.3b, drivers can only cross the line twice before serving their penalty in the pit lane [54.4b]. Vehicles serving time penalties under 54.3a and 54.3b, are not to be worked on until the penalty time is completed [54.4c-d]. Failure to comply results in a potential disqualification [54.4e].

For successful race results moving forward, compliance with these regulations is essential and expected of all team members.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
