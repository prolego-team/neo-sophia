The Rocketdyne Business is the largest liquid rocket propulsion designer, developer, and manufacturer in the U.S. The purchase price of $550 million, which is subject to adjustment for changes in working capital and other specified items, is expected to be financed with a combination of cash on hand, restricted cash on hand related to the issuance of debt in connection with the proposed Acquisition, and future borrowings under the Company's senior credit facility (see Note 6). The Acquisition is conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Subject to the satisfaction of these conditions, the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2013. If the Acquisition is not completed, the Company will be required to pay a termination fee of up to $20.0 million in the event that the purchase agreement is terminated in certain circumstances.",

These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2012, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Certain reclassifications have been made to financial information for the prior year to conform to the current year's presentation.\n\nThe Company believes the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, the operating results for interim periods may not be indicative of the results of operations for a full year.\n\nThe Company is a manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems with a real estate segment that includes activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of the Company's excess real estate assets. The Company's continuing operations are organized into two segments:\n\nAerospace and Defense \u0097 includes the operations of Aerojet-General Corporation (\"Aerojet\") which develops and manufactures propulsion systems for defense and space applications, and armaments for precision tactical and long range weapon systems applications. In connection with the consummation of the Acquisition (as defined below), the name of Aerojet-General Corporation was changed to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Inc. Primary customers served include major prime contractors to the United States (\"U.S.\") government, the Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (\"NASA\").\n\nReal Estate \u0097 includes the activities of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Easton Development Company, LLC (\"Easton\") related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of the Company's excess real estate assets. The Company owns approximately 11,900 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 50 between Rancho Cordova and Folsom, California east of Sacramento (\"Sacramento Land\"). The Company is currently in the process of seeking zoning changes and other governmental approvals on a portion of the Sacramento Land to optimize its value.\n\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. The fiscal year of the Company's subsidiary, Aerojet, ends on the last Saturday of November. As a result of the 2013 calendar, Aerojet had 14 weeks of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 13 weeks of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The additional week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 accounted for $27.8 million in additional net sales.\n\nIn July 2012, the Company signed a stock and asset purchase agreement (the \"Original Purchase Agreement\") with United Technologies Corporation (\"UTC\") to acquire the Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne division (the \"Rocketdyne Business\") from UTC for $550 million (the \"Acquisition\"). The Rocketdyne Business is the largest liquid rocket propulsion designer, developer, and manufacturer in the U.S. On June 10, 2013, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") announced that it closed its investigation into the Acquisition under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. On June 12, 2013, the Company and UTC entered into an amended and restated stock and asset purchase agreement, (the \"Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement\"), which amended and restated the Original Purchase Agreement, as amended. On June 14, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the Rocketdyne Business pursuant to the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement. The aggregate consideration to UTC was $411 million, paid in cash, which represents the initial purchase price of $550 million reduced by $55 million relating to the expected future acquisition of UTC's 50% ownership interest of RD Amross, LLC (a joint venture with NPO Energomash of Khimki, Russia which sells RD-180 engines to RD Amross) and the portion of the UTC business that markets and supports the sale of RD-180 engines. The acquisition of UTC's 50% ownership interest of RD Amross and UTC's related business is expected to close following receipt of the Russian governmental regulatory approvals, if at all. The purchase price was further adjusted for changes in customer advances, capital expenditures and other net assets, and is subject further to post-closing adjustments.\n\nDue to the proximity of the closing of the Acquisition to the end of the Company's reporting period, the initial accounting for the Acquisition has not been completed at this time.",

As a result, during the quarter the Company changed its estimate of useful lives of certain engines to better reflect the estimated periods they are expected to remain in service. In addition, based on this extension of the useful lives for these engines, the Company determined a reduction in the expected residual values was appropriate. These changes in estimates will result in additional depreciation as the majority of the impact is attributable to the residual value reduction.

As reflected in the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit, has suffered significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations, and has limited working capital. The Company expects to incur substantial expenditures for the foreseeable future for the research, development and commercialization of its potential products. In addition, the Company will require additional financing in order to seek to license or acquire new assets, research and develop any potential patents and the related compounds, and obtain any further intellectual property that the Company may seek to acquire. The Company does not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to support its current operating plan. The Company will be required to raise additional capital, obtain alternative means of financial support, or both, in order to continue to fund operations. Therefore, there exists substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Historically, the Company has funded its operations primarily through equity and debt financings and it expects that it will continue to fund its operations through equity and debt financing. If the Company raises additional financing by issuing equity securities, its existing stockholders' ownership will be diluted. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase the Company's liabilities and future cash commitments.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. There is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of the Company's business is dependent upon obtaining additional financing and the continued support of its stockholders to aid in financing operations.

The unaudited interim financial statements are, in the opinion of management, a fair statement of the results for the periods reported and include all necessary adjustments, all of a normal recurring nature, for a fair statement of such results. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted from the unaudited financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Operating results for the interim periods disclosed herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year or any future period. The Corporation embarked on a broad-based multi-year, technological and business process transformation during the second half of 2022. The needs and expectations of the Corporation's clients, as well as the competitive landscape, have evolved, requiring the Corporation to make important investments in its technological infrastructure and adopt more agile practices. The Corporation's technology and business transformation will be a significant priority for the Corporation over the next three years and beyond. As part of this transformation, the Corporation aims to expand its digital capabilities, modernize our technology platform, and implement agile and efficient business processes across the entire Corporation. To facilitate the transparency of the progress with the transformation initiative and to better portray the level of technology related expenses categorized by the nature of the expense, effective in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Corporation has separated technology, professional fees and transactional and items processing related expenses as standalone expense categories in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

    "The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Cavco Industries, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\" or \"Cavco\"), have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.\n\nIn the opinion of management, these statements include all of the normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period classification. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC; there were no disclosable subsequent events. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2012 filed with the SEC on June 12, 2012 (the \"Form 10-K\").\n\nWe reclassified $2.0 million of non-current inventory finance notes receivable to current portion of inventory finance notes receivable for the period ended March 31, 2012. This change had no impact to total inventory finance notes receivable. The Company evaluated the quantitative and qualitative aspects of this adjustment and determined the correction was not material. This reclassification had no impact on the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income or consolidated statements of cash flows for the current or prior fiscal year.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results or cash flows for the full year.\n\nOn January 31, 2013, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Company's change to a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to March 31 of each year in order to improve the alignment of financial and business processes and to streamline financial reporting. Each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks, with an occasional fourth quarter extending to 14 weeks, if necessary, for the fiscal year to end on the Saturday nearest to March 31. This change is effective with the end of Cavco's fiscal third quarter and first nine months ended December 29, 2012. The Company's current fiscal year will end on March 30, 2013.\n\nThe Company operates principally in two segments: (1) factory-built housing, which includes manufactured housing, modular housing and retail operations, and (2) financial services, which includes manufactured housing related consumer finance and insurance.\n\nThrough our Fleetwood Homes, Inc. (\"Fleetwood\") subsidiary, jointly owned by the Company and its investment partners, Third Avenue Value Fund and an affiliate (collectively, \"Third Avenue\"), certain manufactured housing assets and liabilities were acquired on August 17, 2009 (the \"Fleetwood Acquisition Date\"). Third Avenue Management is an investment advisor to Third Avenue Value Fund and is a related party to the Company, as described further in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFinancial information for Fleetwood is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") 810, Consolidation (\"ASC 810\"). Management has determined that, under GAAP, although Fleetwood is only fifty-percent owned by the Company, Cavco has a controlling interest and is required to fully consolidate the results of Fleetwood. The primary factors that contributed to this determination were Cavco's management and board control of Fleetwood wherein members of Cavco's management hold all of the seats on the board of directors of Fleetwood. In addition, as part of a management services agreement among Cavco, Fleetwood and Third Avenue, Cavco provides all executive-level management services to Fleetwood including, among other things, general management oversight, marketing and customer relations, accounting and cash management. Third Avenue's financial interest in Fleetwood is considered a \"redeemable noncontrolling interest,\" and is designated as such in the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 19).",

We also review the underlying inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement of financial instruments to determine if a transfer among hierarchy levels is appropriate. We historically have not had significant transfers into or out of each hierarchy level.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value each period include our derivative instruments, equity investments related to our deferred compensation plan and debt investment securities classified as available for sale securities (see Note 3).

However, if certain triggering events occur (or at least annually for goodwill), an evaluation of the affected non-financial asset or liability will be required, which could result in a reduction to the carrying amount of such asset or liability.\n\nWe concluded that none of our other non-financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value assessments on a non-recurring basis required a material adjustment to the carrying amount of such assets and liabilities for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.",

The beloranib Investigational New Drug application, or IND, was placed on full clinical hold in December 2015 by the FDA, as a result of an imbalance in the number of thrombotic events observed in patients treated with beloranib as compared to patients on placebo in the Company's clinical trials. To address the full clinical hold, the Company held a Type A meeting with the FDA in June 2016 to discuss the clinical and pre-clinical data for beloranib, as well as a proposed risk mitigation strategy for beloranib in PWS. Following its discussions with the FDA, a comprehensive review of the Company's assets and clinical programs, and review of other considerations, the Company determined that the obstacles, costs and development timelines to obtain marketing approval for beloranib were too great to justify additional investment in the program, particularly given the promising emerging profile of ZGN-1061.

    "Unaudited Interim Financial Information The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 was derived from the Company's audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2018 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, have been prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for interim financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2017, on file with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the Company's condensed consolidated financial position as of June 30, 2018 and condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 have been made. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the accrual of research and development expenses and the valuation of stock-based awards. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Actual results could differ from the Company's estimates. Marketable securities Marketable securities consist of investments with original maturities greater than ninety days. The Company has classified its investments with maturities beyond one year as short term, based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. The Company considers its investment portfolio of investments as available-for-sale. Accordingly, these investments are recorded at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are included as a component of other income (expense), net based on the specific identification method. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, the Company considers various factors, including whether the Company has the intent to sell the security, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices. Net Loss Per Share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted common shares, as determined using the treasury stock method. For periods in which the Company has reported net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is antidilutive. The Company excluded the following common stock equivalents, outstanding as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 because they had an anti-dilutive impact due to the net loss incurred for the periods: As of June 30, 2018 2017 Options to purchase common stock 6,261,528 4,185,866 Unvested restricted common stock 8,929 11,065 6,270,457 4,196,931 7",

The loan agreement requires that the Company maintain certain minimum liquidity at all times, which as of June 30, 2019, was approximately $19.1 million. If the minimum liquidity covenant is not met, the Company may be required to repay the loan prior to scheduled maturity dates. Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product revenue, the Company expects to finance its cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other sources of funding.\n\nBased on its current operating plans, the Company believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $91.7 million as of June 30, 2019 will be sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations, capital expenditures and satisfy debt repayments for a period of at least 12 months from the issuance date of this Quarterly Report. The Company expects to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings, the Company may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that the Company would otherwise prefer to develop and market itself.",
    "Zafgen, Inc., or the Company, was incorporated on November 22, 2005 under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is a biopharmaceutical company that has leveraged its proprietary knowledge of the methionine aminopeptidase 2 (\"MetAP2\") pathway to pioneer the study of MetAP2 inhibitors in both common and rare metabolic disorders.\n\nThe Company's prior lead product candidate, ZGN-1061, is a MetAP2 inhibitor that was in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders. In November 2018, the Company received a letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") placing a full clinical hold on the investigational new drug application (\"IND\") for the first U.S. clinical trial of ZGN-1061. The FDA cited the possibility of cardiovascular (\"CV\") safety risk based on the Company's prior compound. In July 2019, the Company reached agreement with the FDA on an in vivo animal study design and protocol to establish relevant safety margins for ZGN-1061. The study was designed to translate the data from the Company's newly developed in vitro assays of human endothelial cells and assessment of tissue factor expression with endothelial cells, along with other supportive assays, as it worked toward resolving the full clinical hold. Based on the preliminary results from the in vivo study, on September 5, 2019, the Company announced that it believes there is a low probability of resolving the clinical hold in the near-term. Subsequently, all further development activities of MetAP2 inhibitors were halted and the Company withdrew the IND for ZGN-1061 in September 2019. Therefore, the Company has determined that it is in the best interest of shareholders to evaluate strategic alternatives. Potential strategic alternatives that may be evaluated include, but are not limited to, an acquisition, merger, business combination, in-licensing, or other strategic transaction involving the Company or its assets. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated. In addition to evaluating strategic alternatives, in September 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and better align the Company's workforce with its needs, which in combination with the July restructuring actions and other attrition in 2019, resulted in a 70% reduction in workforce and closure of its San Diego facility (See Note 10).\n\nThe Company was also co-sponsoring a four-year natural history study which was designed to advance understanding of the medical history of and medical events in people with Prader-Willi syndrome in collaboration with the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research (\"FPWR\"). In October 2019, the Company transferred the study sponsorship and all of the associated rights to the study data to FPWR.\n\nThe Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, compliance with government regulations and the need to obtain additional financing. Future product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive nonclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel infrastructure, and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company's future product candidates' research and development, if any, will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company's intellectual property will be obtained, that any product candidates developed will obtain necessary government regulatory approval or that any approved products will be commercially viable. Even if the Company's product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate significant revenue from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and substantial competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the Company is dependent upon the services of its employees and consultants.\n\nThe Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $389.1 million. From its inception through September 30, 2019, the Company received net proceeds of $397.9 million from the sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, the proceeds from its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in June 2014 and its follow-on offerings in January 2015 and July 2018. On July 2, 2018, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock, which resulted in the sale of 9,200,000 shares at a price of $7.50 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $64.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, as well as offering costs. As disclosed in Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has a term loan with an aggregate principal balance of $16.4 million as of September 30, 2019. The loan agreement requires that the Company maintain certain minimum liquidity at all times, which as of September 30, 2019, was approximately $17.2 million. If the minimum liquidity covenant is not met, the Company may be required to repay the loan prior to scheduled maturity dates. The Term Loan also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of any of which provides the lenders the right to exercise remedies against the Company and the collateral securing the amounts due under the Term Loan. These events of default include, among other things, failure to pay any amounts due under the Term Loan, insolvency, the occurrence of a material adverse event, the occurrence of any default under certain other indebtedness and a final judgment against the Company in an amount greater than $0.3 million. The Company has estimated that the risk of subjective acceleration under the material adverse events clause is reasonably possible,",
    "Zafgen, Inc., or the Company, was incorporated on November 22, 2005 under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is a biopharmaceutical company that has leveraged its proprietary knowledge of the methionine aminopeptidase 2 (\"MetAP2\") pathway to pioneer the study of MetAP2 inhibitors in both common and rare metabolic disorders.\n\nFollowing an extensive process of evaluating strategic alternatives for the Company and identifying and reviewing potential candidates for a strategic acquisition or other transaction, on December 17, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Chondrial Therapeutics, Inc., or Chondrial, pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company will merge with and into Chondrial, with Chondrial continuing as the surviving corporation of the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, or the merger. Under the exchange ratio formula in the Merger Agreement, as of immediately after the merger, the former Chondrial securityholders are expected to own approximately 60% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on a fully-diluted basis and the Company's stockholders as of immediately prior to the merger are expected to own approximately 40% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on a fully-diluted basis. The relative percentage ownership of the combined company was derived using a stipulated value of Chondrial of approximately $67.5 million and of the Company of approximately $45.0 million. The Company's valuation was determined based on a projected net cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance minus outstanding liabilities, as defined in the Merger Agreement, of $40.0 million as of a determination date prior to the closing of the merger, but subject to adjustment as described below, plus an additional $5.0 million of enterprise value. If the Company's actual net cash is between $39.5 million and $40.5 million, no adjustment will be made to the ownership percentages based on the Company's net cash. The Company's target net cash, lower target net cash and upper target net cash amounts will be reduced by $21,311 per day beginning on March 31, 2020 through the closing date of the merger, and the Chondrial valuation will be increased by $111,656 per day beginning on March 31, 2020 through the closing date of the merger, resulting in a corresponding adjustment to the exchange ratio and an increase to the ownership percentage of Chondrial's stockholder in the combined company.\n\nThe Merger Agreement provides the Company and Chondrial with specified termination rights, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $3,375,000. In addition, in connection with certain terminations of the Merger Agreement, either party may be required to pay the other party's third party expenses up to $350,000. In connection with the merger, the Company will seek to amend its certificate of incorporation to: (i) effect a reverse split of the Company's common stock at a ratio to be determined by the Company and Chondrial, which is intended to ensure that the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market are satisfied and (ii) change the name of Zafgen, Inc. to \"Larimar Therapeutics, Inc.\"\n\nThe Company's and Chondrial's obligations to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, among others, obtaining the requisite approvals of the Company's stockholders and satisfaction of minimum net cash thresholds of $30,000,000 by the Company and not less than zero by Chondrial. The sole stockholder of Chondrial has approved the Merger Agreement. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into stockholder support agreements with its current directors and certain officers and the Company's largest stockholder, which collectively beneficially own or control an aggregate of approximately 9.7% of its outstanding shares of common stock. Each of the stockholders party to such stockholder support agreements has agreed to vote or cause to be voted, all of the shares of the Company's common stock beneficially owned by such stockholder in favor of the stockholder proposals submitted at the Company's stockholders meeting to be held in connection with the merger.\n\nThe Company expects to devote significant time and resources to the completion of the merger with Chondrial. However, there can be no assurance that such activities will result in the completion of the merger. Further, the completion of the merger ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $399.9 million.

    "1.Organization, Clinical Development, Nature of the Business, COVID-19, Clinical Hold and Basis of Presentation\n\nOrganization, Clinical Development, Nature of the Business, COVID-19, Clinical Hold and Basis of Presentation\n\nLarimar Therapeutics, Inc., together with its subsidiary (the \"Company\" or \"Larimar\"), is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for patients suffering from complex rare diseases using its novel cell penetrating peptide technology platform. Larimar's lead product candidate, CTI-1601, is a subcutaneously administered, recombinant fusion protein intended to deliver human frataxin (\"FXN\") an essential protein, to the mitochondria of patients with Friedreich's ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia is a rare, progressive and fatal disease in which patients are unable to produce sufficient FXN due to a genetic abnormality.\n\nIn May 2021, Larimar reported positive topline data from its Phase 1 Friedreich's ataxia, (\"FA\") program after completing dosing of the single ascending dose, (\"SAD\"), trial in December 2020 and of the multiple ascending dose, (\"MAD\"), trial in March 2021. Data from these trials demonstrate proof-of-concept by showing that daily subcutaneous injections of CTI-1601 for up to 13 days resulted in dose-dependent increases in FXN levels from baseline compared to placebo in all evaluated tissues (buccal cells, skin, and platelets). FXN levels achieved in peripheral tissues (buccal cells) following daily 50 mg and 100 mg subcutaneous injections of CTI-1601 were at or in excess of FXN levels that would be expected in phenotypically normal heterozygous carriers. There were no serious adverse events, (\"SAEs\"), associated with either the MAD or SAD trials.\n\nIn May 2021, the FDA placed a clinical hold on the Company's CTI-1601 clinical program after the Company notified the agency of mortalities at the highest dose levels of the 26-week non-human primate toxicology study that was designed to support extended dosing of patients with CTI-1601. At the time the hold was placed, Larimar had no interventional clinical trials with patients enrolling or enrolled. In February 2022, in response to the Company submitting a complete response to the FDA, the Agency stated that it was maintaining the clinical hold and that additional data are needed to resolve the clinical hold. Larimar subsequently submitted a request for an FDA Type C meeting. This meeting request has been granted and is scheduled for early in the third quarter of 2022. Throughout the course of the interactions associated with the Type C meeting, Larimar intends to work with the Agency to enable resolution of the clinical hold and to agree on the study design and timing of the next proposed clinical trial. Larimar does not know when, or if the clinical hold will be lifted.\n\nThe Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to pre-commercial companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with governmental regulations, failure to secure regulatory approval for its drug candidates or any other product candidates and the ability to secure additional capital to fund its operations. Drug candidates currently under development will require extensive non-clinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel, and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if our drug development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, we will realize significant revenue from product sales.\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization (\"WHO\"), declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a novel strain of Coronavirus, a global pandemic. The pandemic resulted in the temporary stoppage of the Company's CTI-1601 Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with Friedreich's ataxia in March 2020. In July 2020, the Company resumed these clinical trials, and has since completed both of the Company's SAD and MAD clinical trials. Since being discovered, new variants of COVID-19 have emerged. In November 2021, the Omicron variant was identified in South Africa, and has been deemed a variant of concern by the WHO. In addition to the Omicron variant, the WHO has deemed four other variants to be variants of concern: the Alpha variant, the Beta variant, the Gamma variant, and the Delta variant. All of the aforementioned variants have at least one of the following characteristics resulting in the WHO deeming them variants of concern: an increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, an increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation, or a decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, or therapeutics.\n\nVaccines manufactured by Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson were introduced late in the fourth quarter of 2020 and became widely available by the end of the first quarter of 2021. While the vaccines have proven effective in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19, including the variants that have evolved to date, the overall vaccination rate has not reached the level required for herd immunity in some areas of the country. Further, additional doses of vaccines have been and may continue to be required and individuals may refuse or fail to receive one or more such doses. The incidence of variants of COVID-19 has been increasing, particularly among unvaccinated individuals, and the Omicron variant has proven to be more easily spread than earlier variants.",

For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nUse of Estimates: To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and future results could differ. The allowance for loan losses, valuation of deferred tax assets, loss contingencies, fair value of other real estate owned and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change.\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries, and decreased by charge-offs of loans. Management believes the allowance for loan losses balance to be adequate based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, past loan loss experience, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other relevant factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged-off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Management continues its collection efforts on previously charged-off balances and applies recoveries as additions to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current qualitative factors. The Company maintains a loss migration analysis that tracks loan losses and recoveries based on loan class and the loan risk grade assignment for commercial loans. At March 31, 2020, an 18 month annualized historical loss experience was used for commercial loans and a 12 month historical loss experience period was applied to residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. These historical loss percentages are adjusted (both upwards and downwards) for certain qualitative factors, including economic trends, credit quality trends, valuation trends, concentration risk, quality of loan review, changes in personnel, external factors and other considerations.\n\nA loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is believed to be probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified and a concession has been made, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired.\n\nCommercial and commercial real estate loans with relationship balances exceeding $500,000 and an internal risk grading of 6 or worse are evaluated for impairment. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated and the loan is reported at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans, are collectively evaluated for impairment and they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings are also considered impaired with impairment generally measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception or using the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.\n\nForeclosed Assets: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure, primarily other real estate owned, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Costs after acquisition are expensed unless they add value to the property.\n\nIncome Taxes: Income tax expense is the sum of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nThe Company recognizes a tax position as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the \"more likely than not\" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.",

    "NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Macatawa Bank Corporation (\"the Company\", \"our\", \"we\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Macatawa Bank (\"the Bank\"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Macatawa Bank is a Michigan chartered bank with depository accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank operates 26 full service branch offices providing a full range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services in Kent County, Ottawa County, and northern Allegan County, Michigan. The Company owns all of the common stock of Macatawa Statutory Trust II. This is a grantor trust that issued trust preferred securities and is not consolidated with the Company under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On July 7, 2021, the Company redeemed the $20.0 million outstanding trust preferred securities and $619,000 common securities associated with this trust. Recent Events: On March 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an \"Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus.\" The guidance explained that in consultation with the FASB staff the federal banking agencies concluded that short-term modifications (e.g. six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a modification are not Troubled Debt Restructurings (\"TDRs\"). The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act was passed by Congress on March 27, 2020. Section 4013 of the CARES Act also addressed COVID-19 related modifications and specified that COVID-19 related modifications on loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. On December 27, 2020, another COVID-19 relief bill was signed that extended this guidance until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the date on which the national emergency declared as a result of COVID-19 is terminated. Through June 30, 2021, the Bank had applied this guidance and modified 726 individual loans with aggregate principal balances totaling $337.2 million. As of June 30, 2021, all of these modifications had expired and the loans returned to their contractual payment terms. The CARES Act, as amended, included an allocation of $659 billion for loans to be issued by financial institutions through the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"). PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made on or after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred until either the date on which the SBA remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is 10 months after the last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within that 10 month period. Through December 31, 2020, the Bank had originated 1,738 PPP loans totaling $346.7 million in principal, with an average loan size of $200,000. Fees totaling $10.0 million were generated from the SBA for these loans in the year ended December 31, 2020. These fees are deferred and amortized into interest income over the contractual period of 24 months or 60 months, as applicable. Upon SBA forgiveness, unamortized fees are then recognized into interest income. Participation in the PPP had a significant impact on the Bank's asset mix and net interest income in 2020 and will continue to impact both asset mix and net interest income until these loans are forgiven or paid off. The initial PPP expired on August 8, 2020. Through December 31, 2020, 765 PPP loans totaling $113.5 million had been forgiven by the SBA and a total of $5.4 million in PPP fees had been recognized by the Bank. On December 27, 2020, another COVID-19 relief bill was signed that extended and modified several provisions of the PPP. This included an additional allocation of $284 billion. The SBA reactivated the PPP on January 11, 2021. The Bank originated additional loans through the PPP, which expired on May 31, 2021. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Bank had generated and received SBA approval on 1,000 PPP loans totaling $128.4 million and generated $5.6 million in related deferred PPP fees. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, 833 PPP loans totaling $187.5 million had been forgiven by the SBA and a total of $4.4 million in PPP fees had been recognized by the Bank including fees recognized upon forgiveness and continuing amortization of fees from the 2020 and 2021 PPP originations. While the Company continues to evaluate the disruption caused by the pandemic and impact of the CARES Act, these events may have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of future operations, financial position, capital, and liquidity in fiscal year 2021 and beyond. -10- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) believed necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Use of Estimates: To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and future results could differ. The allowance for loan losses, valuation of deferred tax assets, loss contingencies, fair value of other real estate owned and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change. Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI): The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain officers. BOLI is recorded at its currently realizable cash surrender value. Changes in cash surrender value are recorded in other income. In early April 2021, the Bank purchased an additional $10.0 million in BOLI policies. Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries, and decreased by charge-offs of loans. Management believes the allowance for loan losses balance to be adequate based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, past loan loss experience, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other relevant factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged-off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Management continues its collection efforts on previously charged-off balances and applies recoveries as additions to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current qualitative factors. The Company maintains a loss migration analysis that tracks loan losses and recoveries based on loan class and the loan risk grade assignment for commercial loans. At June 30, 2021, an 18 month annualized historical loss experience was used for commercial loans and a 12 month historical loss experience period was applied to residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. These historical loss percentages are adjusted (both upwards and downwards) for certain qualitative factors, including economic trends, credit quality trends, valuation trends, concentration risk, quality of loan review, changes in personnel, external factors and other considerations. At June 30, 2021, the qualitative factor allocations for economic trends related to the COVID-19 that had been increased significantly during 2020 were maintained reflecting continued uncertainty of economic conditions with the reopening of the economy. PPP loans receive $0 allocation as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA and are subject to be forgiven under the SBA forgiveness criteria. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is believed to be probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified and a concession has been made, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Commercial and commercial real estate loans with relationship balances exceeding $500,000 and an internal risk grading of 6 or worse are evaluated for impairment. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated and the loan is reported at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans, are collectively evaluated for impairment and they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures. Troubled debt restructurings are also considered impaired with impairment generally measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception or using the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. -11- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Foreclosed Assets: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure, primarily other real estate owned, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Costs after acquisition are expensed unless they add value to the property. Income Taxes: Income tax expense is the sum of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company recognizes a tax position as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the \"more likely than not\" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenues as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income from the Bank's loans and investment securities. The Company also earns noninterest revenue from various banking services offered by the Bank. Interest Income: The Company's largest source of revenue is interest income which is primarily recognized on an accrual basis based on contractual terms written into loans and investment contracts. Noninterest Revenue: The Company derives the majority of its noninterest revenue from: (1) service charges for deposit related services, (2) gains related to mortgage loan sales, (3) trust fees and (4) debit and credit card interchange income. Most of these services are transaction based and revenue is recognized as the related service is provided. Derivatives: Certain of the Bank's commercial loan customers have entered into interest rate swap agreements directly with the Bank. At the same time the Bank enters into a swap agreement with its customer, the Bank enters into a corresponding interest rate swap agreement with a correspondent bank at terms mirroring the Bank's interest rate swap with its commercial loan customer. This is known as a back-to-back swap agreement. Under this arrangement the Bank has two freestanding interest rate swaps, each of which is carried at fair value. As the terms mirror each other, there is no income statement impact to the Bank. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the total notional amount of such agreements was $145.6 million and $156.4 million, respectively, and resulted in a derivative asset with a fair value of $3.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which were included in other assets and a derivative liability of $3.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which were included in other liabilities. Mortgage Banking Derivatives: Commitments to fund mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest rate on the loan is locked. The Bank enters into commitments to sell mortgage backed securities, which it later buys back in order to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in its mortgage pipeline. At times, the Bank also enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans when loans are closed but not yet sold, in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to sell the loans. Changes in the fair values of these interest rate lock and mortgage backed security and forward commitment derivatives are included in net gains on mortgage loans. The net fair value of mortgage banking derivatives was approximately $(4,000) and $(130,000) at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Reclassifications: Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. -12- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Newly Issued Not Yet Effective Standards: FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date by replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new guidance eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold and, instead, reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. The new guidance broadens the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually to include forecasted information, as well as past events and current conditions. There is no specified method for measuring expected credit losses, and an entity is allowed to apply methods that reasonably reflect its expectations of the credit loss estimate. Although an entity may still use its current systems and methods for recording the allowance for credit losses, under the new rules, the inputs used to record the allowance for credit losses generally will need to change to appropriately reflect an estimate of all expected credit losses and the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts. Additionally, credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities will now have to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU No. 2019-10 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842) - Effective Dates updated the effective date of this ASU for smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company selected a software vendor for applying this new ASU for Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\"), began implementation of the software in the second quarter of 2018, completed integration during the third quarter of 2018 and ran parallel computations with both systems using the current GAAP incurred loss model in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company went live with this software beginning in January 2019 for its monthly incurred loss computations and began modeling the new current expected credit loss model assumptions to the allowance for loan losses computation. During 2019, 2020 and the first six months of 2021, the Company modeled the various methods prescribed in the ASU against the Company's identified loan segments. The Company anticipates continuing to run parallel computations and fine tune assumptions as it continues to evaluate the impact of adoption of the new standard. The COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in the United States in the first quarter of 2020 and continued into 2021 may have a significant impact on allowance computations under the incurred loss model which could be amplified under the new standard. -13- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Macatawa Bank Corporation (\"the Company\", \"our\", \"we\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Macatawa Bank (\"the Bank\").

As of June 30, 2021, all of these modifications had expired and the loans returned to their contractual payment terms. The CARES Act, as amended, included an allocation of $659 billion for loans to be issued by financial institutions through the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"). PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made on or after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred until either the date on which the SBA remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is 10 months after the last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within that 10 month period. Through December 31, 2020, the Bank had originated 1,738 PPP loans totaling $346.7 million in principal, with an average loan size of $200,000. Fees totaling $10.0 million were generated from the SBA for these loans in the year ended December 31, 2020. These fees are deferred and amortized into interest income over the contractual period of 24 months or 60 months, as applicable. Upon SBA forgiveness, unamortized fees are then recognized into interest income. Participation in the PPP had a significant impact on the Bank's asset mix and net interest income in 2020 and will continue to impact both asset mix and net interest income until these loans are forgiven or paid off. The initial PPP expired on August 8, 2020. Through December 31, 2020, 765 PPP loans totaling $113.5 million had been forgiven by the SBA and a total of $5.4 million in PPP fees had been recognized by the Bank. On December 27, 2020, another COVID-19 relief bill was signed that extended and modified several provisions of the PPP. This included an additional allocation of $284 billion. The SBA reactivated the PPP on January 11, 2021. The Bank originated additional loans through the PPP, which expired on May 31, 2021. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Bank had generated and received SBA approval on 1,000 PPP loans totaling $128.4 million and generated $5.6 million in related deferred PPP fees. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, 833 PPP loans totaling $187.5 million had been forgiven by the SBA and a total of $4.4 million in PPP fees had been recognized by the Bank including fees recognized upon forgiveness and continuing amortization of fees from the 2020 and 2021 PPP originations. While the Company continues to evaluate the disruption caused by the pandemic and impact of the CARES Act, these events may have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of future operations, financial position, capital, and liquidity in fiscal year 2021 and beyond. -10- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) believed necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Use of Estimates: To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and future results could differ. The allowance for loan losses, valuation of deferred tax assets, loss contingencies, fair value of other real estate owned and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change. Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI): The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain officers. BOLI is recorded at its currently realizable cash surrender value. Changes in cash surrender value are recorded in other income. In early April 2021, the Bank purchased an additional $10.0 million in BOLI policies. Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries, and decreased by charge-offs of loans. Management believes the allowance for loan losses balance to be adequate based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, past loan loss experience, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other relevant factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged-off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Management continues its collection efforts on previously charged-off balances and applies recoveries as additions to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current qualitative factors. The Company maintains a loss migration analysis that tracks loan losses and recoveries based on loan class and the loan risk grade assignment for commercial loans. At June 30, 2021, an 18 month annualized historical loss experience was used for commercial loans and a 12 month historical loss experience period was applied to residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. These historical loss percentages are adjusted (both upwards and downwards) for certain qualitative factors, including economic trends, credit quality trends, valuation trends, concentration risk, quality of loan review, changes in personnel, external factors and other considerations. At June 30, 2021, the qualitative factor allocations for economic trends related to the COVID-19 that had been increased significantly during 2020 were maintained reflecting continued uncertainty of economic conditions with the reopening of the economy. PPP loans receive $0 allocation as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA and are subject to be forgiven under the SBA forgiveness criteria. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is believed to be probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified and a concession has been made, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Commercial and commercial real estate loans with relationship balances exceeding $500,000 and an internal risk grading of 6 or worse are evaluated for impairment. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated and the loan is reported at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans, are collectively evaluated for impairment and they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures. Troubled debt restructurings are also considered impaired with impairment generally measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception or using the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. -11- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Foreclosed Assets: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure, primarily other real estate owned, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Costs after acquisition are expensed unless they add value to the property. Income Taxes: Income tax expense is the sum of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company recognizes a tax position as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the \"more likely than not\" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenues as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income from the Bank's loans and investment securities. The Company also earns noninterest revenue from various banking services offered by the Bank. Interest Income: The Company's largest source of revenue is interest income which is primarily recognized on an accrual basis based on contractual terms written into loans and investment contracts. Noninterest Revenue: The Company derives the majority of its noninterest revenue from: (1) service charges for deposit related services, (2) gains related to mortgage loan sales, (3) trust fees and (4) debit and credit card interchange income. Most of these services are transaction based and revenue is recognized as the related service is provided. Derivatives: Certain of the Bank's commercial loan customers have entered into interest rate swap agreements directly with the Bank. At the same time the Bank enters into a swap agreement with its customer, the Bank enters into a corresponding interest rate swap agreement with a correspondent bank at terms mirroring the Bank's interest rate swap with its commercial loan customer. This is known as a back-to-back swap agreement. Under this arrangement the Bank has two freestanding interest rate swaps, each of which is carried at fair value. As the terms mirror each other, there is no income statement impact to the Bank. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the total notional amount of such agreements was $145.6 million and $156.4 million, respectively, and resulted in a derivative asset with a fair value of $3.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which were included in other assets and a derivative liability of $3.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which were included in other liabilities. Mortgage Banking Derivatives: Commitments to fund mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest rate on the loan is locked. The Bank enters into commitments to sell mortgage backed securities, which it later buys back in order to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in its mortgage pipeline. At times, the Bank also enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans when loans are closed but not yet sold, in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to sell the loans. Changes in the fair values of these interest rate lock and mortgage backed security and forward commitment derivatives are included in net gains on mortgage loans. The net fair value of mortgage banking derivatives was approximately $(4,000) and $(130,000) at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Reclassifications: Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. -12- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Newly Issued Not Yet Effective Standards: FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date by replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new guidance eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold and, instead, reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. The new guidance broadens the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually to include forecasted information, as well as past events and current conditions. There is no specified method for measuring expected credit losses, and an entity is allowed to apply methods that reasonably reflect its expectations of the credit loss estimate. Although an entity may still use its current systems and methods for recording the allowance for credit losses, under the new rules, the inputs used to record the allowance for credit losses generally will need to change to appropriately reflect an estimate of all expected credit losses and the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts. Additionally, credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities will now have to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU No. 2019-10 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842) - Effective Dates updated the effective date of this ASU for smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company selected a software vendor for applying this new ASU for Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\"), began implementation of the software in the second quarter of 2018, completed integration during the third quarter of 2018 and ran parallel computations with both systems using the current GAAP incurred loss model in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company went live with this software beginning in January 2019 for its monthly incurred loss computations and began modeling the new current expected credit loss model assumptions to the allowance for loan losses computation. During 2019, 2020 and the first six months of 2021, the Company modeled the various methods prescribed in the ASU against the Company's identified loan segments. The Company anticipates continuing to run parallel computations and fine tune assumptions as it continues to evaluate the impact of adoption of the new standard. The COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in the United States in the first quarter of 2020 and continued into 2021 may have a significant impact on allowance computations under the incurred loss model which could be amplified under the new standard. -13- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Macatawa Bank Corporation (\"the Company\", \"our\", \"we\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Macatawa Bank (\"the Bank\"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Macatawa Bank is a Michigan chartered bank with depository accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank operates 26 full service branch offices providing a full range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services in Kent County, Ottawa County, and northern Allegan County, Michigan. The Company owns all of the common stock of Macatawa Statutory Trust II. This is a grantor trust that issued trust preferred securities and is not consolidated with the Company under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On July 7, 2021, the Company redeemed the $20.0 million outstanding trust preferred securities and $619,000 common securities associated with this trust. Recent Events: On March 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an \"Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus.\" The guidance explained that in consultation with the FASB staff the federal banking agencies concluded that short-term modifications (e.g. six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a modification are not Troubled Debt Restructurings (\"TDRs\"). The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act was passed by Congress on March 27, 2020. Section 4013 of the CARES Act also addressed COVID-19 related modifications and specified that COVID-19 related modifications on loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. On December 27, 2020, another COVID-19 relief bill was signed that extended this guidance until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the date on which the national emergency declared as a result of COVID-19 is terminated.

Section 4013 of the CARES Act also addressed COVID-19 related modifications and specified that COVID-19 related modifications on loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. On December 27, 2020, another COVID-19 relief bill was signed that extended this guidance until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the date on which the national emergency declared as a result of COVID-19 is terminated. Through June 30, 2021, the Bank had applied this guidance and modified 726 individual loans with aggregate principal balances totaling $337.2 million. As of June 30, 2021, all of these modifications had expired and the loans returned to their contractual payment terms. The CARES Act, as amended, included an allocation of $659 billion for loans to be issued by financial institutions through the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"). PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made on or after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred until either the date on which the SBA remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is 10 months after the last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within that 10 month period. Through December 31, 2020, the Bank had originated 1,738 PPP loans totaling $346.7 million in principal, with an average loan size of $200,000. Fees totaling $10.0 million were generated from the SBA for these loans in the year ended December 31, 2020. These fees are deferred and amortized into interest income over the contractual period of 24 months or 60 months, as applicable. Upon SBA forgiveness, unamortized fees are then recognized into interest income. Participation in the PPP had a significant impact on the Bank's asset mix and net interest income in 2020 and will continue to impact both asset mix and net interest income until these loans are forgiven or paid off. The initial PPP expired on August 8, 2020. Through December 31, 2020, 765 PPP loans totaling $113.5 million had been forgiven by the SBA and a total of $5.4 million in PPP fees had been recognized by the Bank. On December 27, 2020, another COVID-19 relief bill was signed that extended and modified several provisions of the PPP. This included an additional allocation of $284 billion. The SBA reactivated the PPP on January 11, 2021. The Bank originated additional loans through the PPP, which expired on May 31, 2021. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Bank had generated and received SBA approval on 1,000 PPP loans totaling $128.4 million and generated $5.6 million in related deferred PPP fees. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, 833 PPP loans totaling $187.5 million had been forgiven by the SBA and a total of $4.4 million in PPP fees had been recognized by the Bank including fees recognized upon forgiveness and continuing amortization of fees from the 2020 and 2021 PPP originations. While the Company continues to evaluate the disruption caused by the pandemic and impact of the CARES Act, these events may have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of future operations, financial position, capital, and liquidity in fiscal year 2021 and beyond. -10- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) believed necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Use of Estimates: To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and future results could differ. The allowance for loan losses, valuation of deferred tax assets, loss contingencies, fair value of other real estate owned and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change. Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI): The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain officers. BOLI is recorded at its currently realizable cash surrender value. Changes in cash surrender value are recorded in other income. In early April 2021, the Bank purchased an additional $10.0 million in BOLI policies. Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries, and decreased by charge-offs of loans. Management believes the allowance for loan losses balance to be adequate based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, past loan loss experience, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other relevant factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged-off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Management continues its collection efforts on previously charged-off balances and applies recoveries as additions to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current qualitative factors. The Company maintains a loss migration analysis that tracks loan losses and recoveries based on loan class and the loan risk grade assignment for commercial loans. At June 30, 2021, an 18 month annualized historical loss experience was used for commercial loans and a 12 month historical loss experience period was applied to residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. These historical loss percentages are adjusted (both upwards and downwards) for certain qualitative factors, including economic trends, credit quality trends, valuation trends, concentration risk, quality of loan review, changes in personnel, external factors and other considerations. At June 30, 2021, the qualitative factor allocations for economic trends related to the COVID-19 that had been increased significantly during 2020 were maintained reflecting continued uncertainty of economic conditions with the reopening of the economy. PPP loans receive $0 allocation as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA and are subject to be forgiven under the SBA forgiveness criteria. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is believed to be probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified and a concession has been made, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Commercial and commercial real estate loans with relationship balances exceeding $500,000 and an internal risk grading of 6 or worse are evaluated for impairment. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated and the loan is reported at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans, are collectively evaluated for impairment and they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures. Troubled debt restructurings are also considered impaired with impairment generally measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception or using the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. -11- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Foreclosed Assets: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure, primarily other real estate owned, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Costs after acquisition are expensed unless they add value to the property. Income Taxes: Income tax expense is the sum of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company recognizes a tax position as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the \"more likely than not\" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenues as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income from the Bank's loans and investment securities. The Company also earns noninterest revenue from various banking services offered by the Bank. Interest Income: The Company's largest source of revenue is interest income which is primarily recognized on an accrual basis based on contractual terms written into loans and investment contracts. Noninterest Revenue: The Company derives the majority of its noninterest revenue from: (1) service charges for deposit related services, (2) gains related to mortgage loan sales, (3) trust fees and (4) debit and credit card interchange income. Most of these services are transaction based and revenue is recognized as the related service is provided. Derivatives: Certain of the Bank's commercial loan customers have entered into interest rate swap agreements directly with the Bank. At the same time the Bank enters into a swap agreement with its customer, the Bank enters into a corresponding interest rate swap agreement with a correspondent bank at terms mirroring the Bank's interest rate swap with its commercial loan customer. This is known as a back-to-back swap agreement. Under this arrangement the Bank has two freestanding interest rate swaps, each of which is carried at fair value. As the terms mirror each other, there is no income statement impact to the Bank. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the total notional amount of such agreements was $145.6 million and $156.4 million, respectively, and resulted in a derivative asset with a fair value of $3.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which were included in other assets and a derivative liability of $3.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which were included in other liabilities. Mortgage Banking Derivatives: Commitments to fund mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest rate on the loan is locked. The Bank enters into commitments to sell mortgage backed securities, which it later buys back in order to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in its mortgage pipeline. At times, the Bank also enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans when loans are closed but not yet sold, in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to sell the loans. Changes in the fair values of these interest rate lock and mortgage backed security and forward commitment derivatives are included in net gains on mortgage loans. The net fair value of mortgage banking derivatives was approximately $(4,000) and $(130,000) at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Reclassifications: Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. -12- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Newly Issued Not Yet Effective Standards: FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date by replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new guidance eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold and, instead, reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. The new guidance broadens the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually to include forecasted information, as well as past events and current conditions. There is no specified method for measuring expected credit losses, and an entity is allowed to apply methods that reasonably reflect its expectations of the credit loss estimate. Although an entity may still use its current systems and methods for recording the allowance for credit losses, under the new rules, the inputs used to record the allowance for credit losses generally will need to change to appropriately reflect an estimate of all expected credit losses and the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts. Additionally, credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities will now have to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU No. 2019-10 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842) - Effective Dates updated the effective date of this ASU for smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company selected a software vendor for applying this new ASU for Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\"), began implementation of the software in the second quarter of 2018, completed integration during the third quarter of 2018 and ran parallel computations with both systems using the current GAAP incurred loss model in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company went live with this software beginning in January 2019 for its monthly incurred loss computations and began modeling the new current expected credit loss model assumptions to the allowance for loan losses computation. During 2019, 2020 and the first six months of 2021, the Company modeled the various methods prescribed in the ASU against the Company's identified loan segments. The Company anticipates continuing to run parallel computations and fine tune assumptions as it continues to evaluate the impact of adoption of the new standard. The COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in the United States in the first quarter of 2020 and continued into 2021 may have a significant impact on allowance computations under the incurred loss model which could be amplified under the new standard. -13- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Macatawa Bank Corporation (\"the Company\", \"our\", \"we\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Macatawa Bank (\"the Bank\"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Macatawa Bank is a Michigan chartered bank with depository accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank operates 26 full service branch offices providing a full range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services in Kent County, Ottawa County, and northern Allegan County, Michigan. The Company owns all of the common stock of Macatawa Statutory Trust II. This is a grantor trust that issued trust preferred securities and is not consolidated with the Company under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On July 7, 2021, the Company redeemed the $20.0 million outstanding trust preferred securities and $619,000 common securities associated with this trust.

On July 7, 2021, the Company redeemed the $20.0 million outstanding trust preferred securities and $619,000 common securities associated with this trust. Recent Events: On March 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an \"Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus.\" The guidance explained that in consultation with the FASB staff the federal banking agencies concluded that short-term modifications (e.g. six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a modification are not Troubled Debt Restructurings (\"TDRs\"). The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act was passed by Congress on March 27, 2020. Section 4013 of the CARES Act also addressed COVID-19 related modifications and specified that COVID-19 related modifications on loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. On December 27, 2020, another COVID-19 relief bill was signed that extended this guidance until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the date on which the national emergency declared as a result of COVID-19 is terminated. Through June 30, 2021, the Bank had applied this guidance and modified 726 individual loans with aggregate principal balances totaling $337.2 million. As of June 30, 2021, all of these modifications had expired and the loans returned to their contractual payment terms. The CARES Act, as amended, included an allocation of $659 billion for loans to be issued by financial institutions through the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"). PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made on or after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred until either the date on which the SBA remits the amount of forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is 10 months after the last day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within that 10 month period. Through December 31, 2020, the Bank had originated 1,738 PPP loans totaling $346.7 million in principal, with an average loan size of $200,000. Fees totaling $10.0 million were generated from the SBA for these loans in the year ended December 31, 2020. These fees are deferred and amortized into interest income over the contractual period of 24 months or 60 months, as applicable. Upon SBA forgiveness, unamortized fees are then recognized into interest income. Participation in the PPP had a significant impact on the Bank's asset mix and net interest income in 2020 and will continue to impact both asset mix and net interest income until these loans are forgiven or paid off. The initial PPP expired on August 8, 2020. Through December 31, 2020, 765 PPP loans totaling $113.5 million had been forgiven by the SBA and a total of $5.4 million in PPP fees had been recognized by the Bank. On December 27, 2020, another COVID-19 relief bill was signed that extended and modified several provisions of the PPP. This included an additional allocation of $284 billion. The SBA reactivated the PPP on January 11, 2021. The Bank originated additional loans through the PPP, which expired on May 31, 2021. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Bank had generated and received SBA approval on 1,000 PPP loans totaling $128.4 million and generated $5.6 million in related deferred PPP fees. In the six months ended June 30, 2021, 833 PPP loans totaling $187.5 million had been forgiven by the SBA and a total of $4.4 million in PPP fees had been recognized by the Bank including fees recognized upon forgiveness and continuing amortization of fees from the 2020 and 2021 PPP originations. While the Company continues to evaluate the disruption caused by the pandemic and impact of the CARES Act, these events may have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of future operations, financial position, capital, and liquidity in fiscal year 2021 and beyond. -10- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) believed necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Use of Estimates: To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and future results could differ. The allowance for loan losses, valuation of deferred tax assets, loss contingencies, fair value of other real estate owned and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change. Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI): The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain officers. BOLI is recorded at its currently realizable cash surrender value. Changes in cash surrender value are recorded in other income. In early April 2021, the Bank purchased an additional $10.0 million in BOLI policies. Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses (allowance) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries, and decreased by charge-offs of loans. Management believes the allowance for loan losses balance to be adequate based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, past loan loss experience, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other relevant factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged-off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Management continues its collection efforts on previously charged-off balances and applies recoveries as additions to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current qualitative factors. The Company maintains a loss migration analysis that tracks loan losses and recoveries based on loan class and the loan risk grade assignment for commercial loans. At June 30, 2021, an 18 month annualized historical loss experience was used for commercial loans and a 12 month historical loss experience period was applied to residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. These historical loss percentages are adjusted (both upwards and downwards) for certain qualitative factors, including economic trends, credit quality trends, valuation trends, concentration risk, quality of loan review, changes in personnel, external factors and other considerations. At June 30, 2021, the qualitative factor allocations for economic trends related to the COVID-19 that had been increased significantly during 2020 were maintained reflecting continued uncertainty of economic conditions with the reopening of the economy. PPP loans receive $0 allocation as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA and are subject to be forgiven under the SBA forgiveness criteria. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is believed to be probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified and a concession has been made, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Commercial and commercial real estate loans with relationship balances exceeding $500,000 and an internal risk grading of 6 or worse are evaluated for impairment. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated and the loan is reported at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans, are collectively evaluated for impairment and they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures. Troubled debt restructurings are also considered impaired with impairment generally measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception or using the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. -11- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Foreclosed Assets: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure, primarily other real estate owned, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Costs after acquisition are expensed unless they add value to the property. Income Taxes: Income tax expense is the sum of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company recognizes a tax position as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the \"more likely than not\" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenues as they are earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's primary source of revenue is interest income from the Bank's loans and investment securities. The Company also earns noninterest revenue from various banking services offered by the Bank. Interest Income: The Company's largest source of revenue is interest income which is primarily recognized on an accrual basis based on contractual terms written into loans and investment contracts. Noninterest Revenue: The Company derives the majority of its noninterest revenue from: (1) service charges for deposit related services, (2) gains related to mortgage loan sales, (3) trust fees and (4) debit and credit card interchange income. Most of these services are transaction based and revenue is recognized as the related service is provided. Derivatives: Certain of the Bank's commercial loan customers have entered into interest rate swap agreements directly with the Bank. At the same time the Bank enters into a swap agreement with its customer, the Bank enters into a corresponding interest rate swap agreement with a correspondent bank at terms mirroring the Bank's interest rate swap with its commercial loan customer. This is known as a back-to-back swap agreement. Under this arrangement the Bank has two freestanding interest rate swaps, each of which is carried at fair value. As the terms mirror each other, there is no income statement impact to the Bank. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the total notional amount of such agreements was $145.6 million and $156.4 million, respectively, and resulted in a derivative asset with a fair value of $3.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which were included in other assets and a derivative liability of $3.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which were included in other liabilities. Mortgage Banking Derivatives: Commitments to fund mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest rate on the loan is locked. The Bank enters into commitments to sell mortgage backed securities, which it later buys back in order to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in its mortgage pipeline. At times, the Bank also enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans when loans are closed but not yet sold, in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to sell the loans. Changes in the fair values of these interest rate lock and mortgage backed security and forward commitment derivatives are included in net gains on mortgage loans. The net fair value of mortgage banking derivatives was approximately $(4,000) and $(130,000) at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Reclassifications: Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. -12- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Newly Issued Not Yet Effective Standards: FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU provides financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date by replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new guidance eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold and, instead, reflects an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. The new guidance broadens the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually to include forecasted information, as well as past events and current conditions. There is no specified method for measuring expected credit losses, and an entity is allowed to apply methods that reasonably reflect its expectations of the credit loss estimate. Although an entity may still use its current systems and methods for recording the allowance for credit losses, under the new rules, the inputs used to record the allowance for credit losses generally will need to change to appropriately reflect an estimate of all expected credit losses and the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts. Additionally, credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities will now have to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU No. 2019-10 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842) - Effective Dates updated the effective date of this ASU for smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company selected a software vendor for applying this new ASU for Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\"), began implementation of the software in the second quarter of 2018, completed integration during the third quarter of 2018 and ran parallel computations with both systems using the current GAAP incurred loss model in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company went live with this software beginning in January 2019 for its monthly incurred loss computations and began modeling the new current expected credit loss model assumptions to the allowance for loan losses computation. During 2019, 2020 and the first six months of 2021, the Company modeled the various methods prescribed in the ASU against the Company's identified loan segments. The Company anticipates continuing to run parallel computations and fine tune assumptions as it continues to evaluate the impact of adoption of the new standard. The COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in the United States in the first quarter of 2020 and continued into 2021 may have a significant impact on allowance computations under the incurred loss model which could be amplified under the new standard. -13- Index MACATAWA BANK CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Macatawa Bank Corporation (\"the Company\", \"our\", \"we\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Macatawa Bank (\"the Bank\").

These consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.\n\nPrinciples of consolidation: The Company consolidates majority-owned, investment company subsidiaries. The Company does not own any controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company, which would also require consolidation. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\n\nFair value of financial instruments: The Company applies fair value to substantially all of its financial instruments. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework to measure fair value, and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is determined through the use of models and other valuation techniques, valuation inputs, and assumptions market participants would use to value the investment. Highest priority is given to prices for identical assets quoted in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority is given to unobservable valuation inputs (Level 3). The availability of observable inputs can vary significantly and is affected by many factors, including the type of product, whether the product is new to the market, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on less observable or unobservable inputs, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for financial instruments classified as Level 3 (i.e., those instruments valued using non-observable inputs), which comprise the entirety of the Company's investments.\n\nChanges to the valuation policy are reviewed by management and the Company's Board. As the Company's investments change, markets change, new products develop, and valuation inputs become more or less observable, the Company will continue to refine its valuation methodologies.\n\nSee Note 6 for more detailed disclosures of the Company's fair value measurements of its financial instruments.\n\nInvestment classification: The Company classifies its investments in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, \"Control Investments\" are defined as investments in those companies in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities or has rights to maintain greater than 50% of board representation, \"Affiliate Investments\" are defined as investments in those companies in which the Company owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities, and \"Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\" are those that neither qualify as Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.",

    "SLAM CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited balance sheet and notes thereto included in the Form 8-K and the final prospectus filed by the Company with the SEC on March 3, 2021 and February 24, 2021, respectively. In April 2021, the Company identified a misstatement in its accounting treatment for warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (the \"Public Warrants\") and the Private Placement Warrants (collectively, the \"Warrants\") as presented in its audited balance sheet as of February 25, 2021 included in its Current Report on Form 8-K, filed March 3, 2021. The Warrants were reflected as a component of equity as opposed to liabilities on the balance sheet. Pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, and Staff Accounting Bulletin 99, \"Materiality\") (\"SAB 99\") issued by the SEC, the Company determined the impact of the error was immaterial. The following balance sheet items were impacted from the error correction as of February 25, 2021: an increase of $59.7 million in warrant liabilities; a decrease of $59.7 million in the amount of Class A ordinary shares subject to redemption; an increase of $4.7 million in additional paid-in capital; and an increase of $4.7 million in accumulated deficit. Emerging Growth Company The Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\"), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company's financial statement with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statement in conformity with GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly form those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage limit of $250,000. As of March 31, 2021, the Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents as of March 31, 2021. Investments Held in Trust Account The Company's portfolio of investments held in trust is comprised solely of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities, or a combination thereof. The Company's investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these investments are included in interest income held in Trust Account in the accompanying statement of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information. 8\n\nSLAM CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Instruments The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under the FASB ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\" approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheets. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Derivative warrant liabilities The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815-15. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. The 14,375,000 warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (the \"Public Warrants\") and the 11,333,333 Private Placement Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815-40. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company's statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants are measured at fair value using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption The Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 \"Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.\" Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company's control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders' equity. The Company's Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company's control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at March 31, 2021, 50,165,691 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders' equity section of the Company's balance sheet. 9\n\nLevel 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;\n\nLevel 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\n\nLevel 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\n\nSLAM CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Taxes The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, \"Income Taxes\". ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company's management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company's only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of February 25, 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. There is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman federal income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company's financial statement. The Company's management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. Net income (loss) per ordinary share Net income per share of ordinary share is computed by dividing net income applicable to shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. The Company has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of 25,708,333 Class A ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. As a result, diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share for the periods presented. The Company's statement of operations includes a presentation of income (loss) per ordinary share subject to redemption in a manner similar to the two-class method of income per share. Net income per share, basic and diluted for Class A ordinary shares is calculated by dividing the income from investments held in the Trust Account of approximately $3,200 for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, by the weighted average number Class A ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Net income per share, basic and diluted for Class B ordinary shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 is calculated by dividing the sum of all general and administration expenses of approximately $618,000, noncash income for a change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of $4.7 million and offering costs associated with derivative warrant liabilities of approximately $1.7 million, resulting in net loss of approximately $7.1 million, by the weighted average number of Class B ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Recent Accounting Standards In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2020-06, Debt\u0097Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging\u0097Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (\"ASU 2020-06\"), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021. Adoption of the ASU did not impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company's management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. 10\n\nSLAM CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 3 \u0097 Initial Public Offering On February 25, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 57,500,000 Units, including 7,500,000 Over-Allotment Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $575.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $32.5 million, of which approximately $20.1 million was for deferred underwriting commissions. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant (\"Public Warrant\"). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). Note 4 \u0097 Related Party Transactions Founder Shares On December 31, 2020, the Sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000 for certain expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for issuance of 14,375,000 Class B ordinary shares (the \"Founder Shares\"). In January 2021, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 120,000 Founder Shares to the independent directors, 30,000 Founder Shares to an officer of the company and 30,000 Founder Shares to the Company's special advisor. The Sponsor agreed to forfeit up to an aggregate of 1,875,000 Founder Shares to the extent that the option to purchase additional Units was not exercised in full by the underwriters, so that the Founder Shares would represent 20% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. On February 25, 2021, the underwriter fully exercised its over-allotment option; thus, these 1,875,000 Founder Shares were no longer subject to forfeiture. The Initial Shareholders agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier if, subsequent to the initial Business Combination, the closing price of the Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, capitalization of shares, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination, and (B) the date following the completion of the initial Business Combination on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company's shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Private Placement Warrants Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 11,333,333 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $17.0 million. Each whole Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one whole Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable except as described below in Note 7 and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. The Sponsor, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Private Placement Warrants until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination. 11\n\nSLAM CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Related Party Loans On December 31, 2020, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to $300,000 to be used for the payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the \"Note\"). The Note was non-interest bearing, unsecured and due upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Company borrowed approximately $196,000 under the Note and repaid the Note in full on February 25, 2021. In addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company's officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (\"Working Capital Loans\"). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company may repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lenders' discretion, up to $1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. As of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans. Administrative Services Agreement Commencing on the date that the Company's securities were first listed on Nasdaq through the earlier of consummation of the initial Business Combination and the liquidation, the Company agreed to pay the Sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of the Company's management team. In addition, the Sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on the Company's behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. The audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by the Company to the Sponsor, officers or directors, or the Company's or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial Business Combination will be made from funds held outside the Trust Account. Note 5 \u0097 Commitments and Contingencies Registration and Shareholder Rights The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans) were entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement signed upon the effective date of the Initial Public Offering. The holders of these securities were entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company registers such securities. In addition, the holders have certain \"piggy-back\" registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the initial Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of the prospectus to purchase up to 7,500,000 additional Units at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On February 25, 2021, the underwriter fully exercised its over-allotment option. The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of $0.20 per unit, or $11.5 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, $0.35 per unit, or approximately $20.1 million in the 12\n\nSLAM CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Consulting Agreements Subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor entered into consulting agreements with two consultants to assist the Company in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination. As part of the agreements, the Sponsor will pay an aggregate amount of $550,000 per annum to the consultants. Risks and Uncertainties Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company's financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statement. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Note 6 \u0097 Shareholders' Equity Preferred Shares \u0097 The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 preference shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of March 31, 2021, there were no preference shares issued or outstanding. Class A Ordinary Shares \u0097 The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 Class A ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of the Company's Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. As of March 31, 2021, there were 7,334,309 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding, excluding 50,165,691 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption. Class B Ordinary Shares \u0097 The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 Class B ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. On February 25, 2021, the Company issued 14,375,000 Class B ordinary shares, including an aggregate of up to 1,875,000 Class B ordinary shares that were subject to forfeiture, to the Company by the Initial Shareholders for no consideration to the extent that the underwriters' option to purchase additional Units was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Class B ordinary shares would collectively represent 20% of the Company's issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the Initial Public Offering. On February 25, 2021, the underwriter fully exercised its over-allotment option; thus, these 1,875,000 Class B ordinary shares were no longer subject to forfeiture. Ordinary shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders and holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders except as required by law; provided that only holders of Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors prior to or in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the consummation of the initial Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares outstanding after such conversion (after giving effect to any redemptions of Class A ordinary shares by Public Shareholders), including the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. Note 7 \u0097 Derivative Warrant Liabilities As of March 31, 2021, the Company had 14,375,000 Public Warrants and 11,333,333 Private Warrants outstanding. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering; provided in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the 13\n\nSLAM CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder (or the Company permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under certain circumstances). The Company agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a \"cashless basis\" in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a \"covered security\" under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a \"cashless basis\" and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. The warrants have an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustments, and will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Initial Shareholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Initial Shareholders or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the \"Newly Issued Price\"), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of Class A ordinary shares during the 10-trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the \"Market Value\") is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price See \"\u0097 Redemption of warrants when the price per class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00\" and \"\u0097 Redemption of warrants when the price per class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00\" as described below). The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except (i) that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions, (ii) except as described below, the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor or such its permitted transferees and (iii) the Sponsor or its permitted transferees will have the option to exercise the Private Placement Warrants on a cashless basis and have certain registration rights. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00: Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may call the outstanding warrants for redemption (except as described herein with respect to the Private Placement Warrants): in whole and not in part; 14",
    "SLAM CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Initial Shareholders agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Company's Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution in the Trust Account will be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company's indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have vendors, service providers (except the Company's independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be successful in obtaining such waivers from its targeted vendors and service providers.

    "Investment in Hotel Properties \u0096 Investments in hotel properties include investments in operating properties which are recorded at acquisition cost and allocated to land, property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. Replacements and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Upon the sale or retirement of a fixed asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Company's accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the statements of operations. Expenditures under a renovation project, which constitute additions or improvements that extend the life of the property, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 7 to 39 years for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets.\n\nThe Company reviews its investments in hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause a review include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the demand for lodging at the properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where the hotels are located. When such conditions exist, management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceed its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel property's estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized.\n\nInvestment in Joint Venture \u0096 Investment in joint venture represents the Company's noncontrolling indirect 25.0% equity interest in (i) the entity that owns the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort; (ii) the entity that leases the hotel and has engaged MHI Hotels Services to operate the hotel under a management contract; (iii) the entity that had an option to purchase a three-acre development site with parking garage adjacent to the hotel and which leased the parking garage for use by the hotel; and (iv) the entity that owned the $22.0 million junior participation in the existing mortgage.

The Company also has the opportunity to earn an incentive participation in the net sale proceeds based upon the achievement of certain overall investment returns, in addition to its pro rata share of net sale proceeds.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \u0096 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk \u0096 The Company holds cash accounts at several institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \"FDIC\") protection limits of $250,000. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of the failure of these institutions is represented by the difference between the FDIC protection limit and the total amounts on deposit. Management monitors, on a regular basis, the financial condition of the financial institutions along with the balances there on deposit to minimize the Company's potential risk.\n\nRestricted Cash \u0096 Restricted cash includes real estate tax escrows, insurance escrows and reserves for replacements of furniture, fixtures and equipment pursuant to certain requirements in the Company's various mortgage agreements and line of credit.",

Events or circumstances that may cause a review include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the demand for lodging at the properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where the hotels are located.

    "Star Peak Energy Transition Corp., formerly known as Star Peak Energy Acquisition Corp. (the \"Company\"), is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on October 29, 2018 (inception) for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the \"Business Combination\"). While the Company may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, it intends to focus its efforts primarily on identifying businesses seeking to be a market leader in, and/or benefit from the increasing global initiatives to improve the efficiency of our energy ecosystems and reduce emissions (the \"Energy Transition\"). The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from October 29, 2018 (inception) through September 30, 2020 relates to the Company's formation and the initial public offering (the \"Initial Public Offering\") and since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company temporary halted the Initial Public Offering in September 2019 and recapitalized and continued in July 2020. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\n\nThe Company's sponsor is Star Peak Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \"Sponsor\"). The registration statement for the Company's Initial Public Offering was declared effective on August 17, 2020. On August 20, 2020, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 35,000,000 units (the \"Units\" and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the \"Public Shares\") at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $350.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $20.0 million, inclusive of approximately $12.3 million in deferred underwriting commissions (Note 5). On August 26, 2020, the Company consummated the sale of 3,358,504 Units at the Initial Public Offering price at $10.00 per Unit pursuant to the notice of partial exercise from the underwriters, generating additional gross proceeds of approximately $33.6 million, and incurring additional offering costs of approximately $1.8 million, inclusive of approximately $1.2 million in deferred underwriting commissions.\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (\"Private Placement\") of 6,733,333 warrants (each, a \"Private Placement Warrant\" and collectively, the \"Private Placement Warrants\") at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $10.1 million (Note 4). In connection with the consummation of the sale of additional Units pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option, on August 26, 2020, the Company sold 447,801 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor, generating additional gross proceeds of approximately $0.7 million.\n\nUpon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement on August 20, 2020, $350.0 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (\"Trust Account\"), located in the United States at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. \"government securities\" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the assets held in the Trust Account as described below. Upon closing of the sale of Units and Private Placement Warrants upon exercise of the over-allotment, on August 26, 2020, $34.3 million of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units and Private Placement Warrants were placed in the Trust Account.\n\nThe Company's management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. If the Company's securities are listed on a national securities exchange, the Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the \"Investment Company Act\").",
