Subject: Compliance with FIA Regulation 31 - Scrutineering Policies

Team,

In light of upholding the highest standards established by Formula 1's regulating body, the FIA, I'd like to iterate the importance of stringent adherence to Regulation 31: Scrutineering. Here is a summarized version of the responsibilities and procedures to be mindful of:

1. **Initial Scrutineering and Declarations** [31.1]: Every competitor must conduct the initial scrutineering of their cars four hours prior to the start of P1. The completed declaration should be submitted no later than two hours before the start of P1, using the Declaration Form Template provided by the FIA.

2. **Compliance with Time Limits** [31.2]: Competitors must adhere to the specified time limits unless they have acquired prior written permission from the Technical Delegate. Those who fail to do this will be subject to the stewards' adjudication.

3. **Participation Requirements** [31.3]: A car is not allowed to partake in the competition until the completed declaration mentioned in Article 31.1 has been submitted and approved by the Technical Delegate.

4. **Change in Survival Cell** [31.4]: Should a competitor make changes to the survival cell after the initial scrutineering, a new declaration has to be completed and approved by the Technical Delegate. The use of such a car is allowed solely the following day.

5. **Scrutineer's Powers** [31.5 a-d]: Scrutineers have the right to examine the eligibility and conformity of a car or competitor during a competition at any time and may require the dismantling of a car. The scrutineers can also ask a competitor to shoulder the expenses related to checks and scrutinizing. Additionally, the scrutineers can request the competitor to provide required parts or samples.

6. **Accident-Related Checks** [31.6]: In the event of an accident, the Race Director or the clerk of the course can demand that the involved car be stopped for checking.

7. **Responsibility of Checks and Scrutineering** [31.7]: Only appointed officials are tasked with performing checks and scrutineering, as well as managing the parc ferm√©. They are the only ones authorized to give instructions to the competitors.

8. **Publication of Scrutineering Findings** [31.8]: The findings of the scrutineers are to be published by the stewards each time cars are checked during the competition. The results will not feature any specific numbers, except when a car violates the Technical Regulations.

We expect the full cooperation of all team members in complying with these regulations. This will not only ensure our continued participation in races but also strengthen our reputation as a compliant competitor in this highly regulated sport.

Thank you.
