Subject: Important Notice Regarding Compliance with FIA Financial Regulations

Dear team members,

As part of our ongoing commitment to adhere to Financial Regulations set by the FIA, we would like to share a summary of important articles concerning the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel (CCAP).

1. CCAP Composition, Function and Authority: A panel of independent judges, known as the CCAP, hears and determines cases of alleged breaches of Financial Regulations as referred by the Cost Cap Administration (CCA). The decisions can be appealed to the International Court of Appeal (ICA) [7.1].

2. Case Referral: The CCA will refer a case to the CCAP in several circumstances such as an F1 Team committing a Procedural Breach, or failing to comply with an Agreement of Breach and Remedy (ABA), or upon the receipt of a complaint from another team [7.2].

3. CCAP Membership: The CCAP consists of 6-12 judges elected by FIA General Assembly from candidates proposed by FIA Sport Members or a group of at least five F1 Teams. Every two years, judges elect a president and VP amongst themselves [7.4, 7.5].

4. Judges' Mandate: Judges serve a four-year mandate, starting on 1st January following their election, and they are eligible for renewal twice. If a seat becomes vacant causing the total number of judges to fall below six, a replacement is elected by the General Assembly [7.7, 7.8].

5. Hearing Composition: For each hearing, at least three Judges form the panel, including at least one Judge proposed by a group of five F1 Teams. The panel, appointed by the President of the CCAP, must not have any conflict of interest [7.9, 7.10, 7.11].

6. Hearing Procedures: Hearings invite representation by the FIA and the 'Respondent' F1 team, along with potential witnesses and third-party observers. The FIA and the Respondent may present written evidence to the President of the Hearing [7.13, 7.14, 7.15, 7.16, 7.17, 7.18].

7. Hearing Closure and Decision: After closure of a hearing, the judging panel convenes to reach a decision, which is then communicated to the FIA and the Respondent. The decision, including any sanctions and costs, is then published by the CCAP [7.22, 7.23, 7.24, 7.26, 7.27].

8. Decision Review: If new evidence is discovered within three months that might affect the CCAP's decision, the CCAP may choose to re-examine it, following a process that respects the rights of both Parties [7.28].

9. Appeals: An appeal of CCAP's decision can be made to the ICA by the F1 Team in question, the FIA or the individuals who are the subject of a decision by the CCAP [7.29, 7.30].

Please review these details carefully and join us in ensuring our complete compliance with these regulations. Any questions or clarifications may be directed to the compliance office.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
