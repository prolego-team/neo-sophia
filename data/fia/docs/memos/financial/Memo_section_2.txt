SUBJECT: Summary of Financial Regulations from FIA - Articles 2.1 to 2.11

Dear Team,

Kindly consider the following summarized regulations from the FIA as extreme importance:

1. As per FIA obligation [2.1], our team must demonstrate compliance with the Cost Cap â€“ submitting Reporting Documentation for each Reporting Period to the Cost Cap Administration, cooperatively assisting with any investigations, dispensing information pertinent to compliance, and abiding by these regulations in good faith.

2. Under the cap on Relevant Costs [2.2], we must determine and report our Relevant Costs against the Cost Cap, and not exceed this Cost Cap for the Full Year Reporting Period.

3. The Cost Cap as of 31 December 2023 and subsequent Full Year Reporting Periods [2.3] will be $135,000,000, with adjustments based on the number of Competitions (< 21 or > 21) for the given period. Each decrease or increase due to Competition numbers will be at $1,800,000 per "X" (difference in actual Competitions and 21). Cancellation of any Competition less than three months before its start will count as a held competition.

4. Currency conversion for the Cost Cap is to be made at the Initial Applicable Rate for teams with non-US Dollars Presentation Currencies. It illustrates a break down for Pounds Sterling, Euros, and Swiss Francs [2.4].

5. The Reporting Group will encompass the F1 Team and, if less than 95% of the F1 Activities' costs are borne by the team, any additional entities within the Legal Group Structure as per [2.5, 2.6]. The entity or entities to be included will be those with the highest costs and continued until the cost margin reaches or exceeds 95%.

6. Additional entities within the Legal Group Structure may also be included in the Reporting Group voluntarily [2.7].

7. In calculations for Articles [2.5 to 2.7], Finance Costs and Marketing Activities' costs are not considered, and adjustments for internal costs are made [2.8].

8. No entity may be a part of more than one F1 Team's Reporting Group as indicated in [2.9]. If this circumstance arises, the entity will be included in the Reporting Group of the team for which it incurs the most costs.

9. Relevant Cost calculations, as per [2.10], should include all costs excluding Finance Costs and Marketing Activities' costs, made by entities within the Legal Group but outside the Reporting Group; either recharged to a Reporting Group Entity or included as a Related Party Transaction [Article 4.1(a)(i)].

10. When uncertain of including an entity within the Reporting Group, the team should seek clarification from the Cost Cap Administration [2.11].

Please ensure full understanding and adherence to these regulations to ensure our team's complete compliance.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

.Kind regards,

Compliance Assistant
