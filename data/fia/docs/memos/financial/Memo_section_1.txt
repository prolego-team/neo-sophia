SUBJECT: Summary of FIA Financial Regulations and Expected Compliance Standards

Dear Team, 

This memo sums up the key points of the Financial Regulations enforced by the FIA as of January 1, 2021 [1.1]. It is essential that we fully understand and comply with these stipulations, as they constitute the conditions of our participation in the Championship.

1. Aim and Application of Regulations: The regulations define a Cost Cap that sets the limits on certain expenditures which can be incurred on behalf of our team each Full Year Reporting Period [1.2]. They are designed to promote competitiveness, sporting fairness, and long-term financial stability and sustainability of all F1 Teams, while also maintaining the technological and engineering challenges unique to Formula 1 [1.3, 1.4]. 

2. Language of Interpretation and Legal Validity: The regulations are interpreted and applied based on the English version, and the appendices contain the meaning of capitalized terms in these regulations [1.5]. If any part of these regulations is deemed illegal, invalid, or unenforceable by a competent court or authority, it will not be part of the regulations [1.6].

3. Amendments: The Cost Cap Administration will review the Financial Regulations periodically, and the FIA World Motor Sport Council may amend or supplement them at any given time [1.7].

4. Accountability and Compliance: All Personnel must be aware of the regulations' content, substance, and objectives, knowing that our team is subject to them [1.8]. It is crucial that staff members understand how their areas of responsibility might impact compliance [1.9]. Furthermore, our team must ensure that the FIA ethics and compliance policy concerning these regulations is clearly communicated to all Personnel [1.10].

Your full understanding and adherence to these regulations are vital to the team's continuous participation and overall success within the Championship. Please review carefully, ensure that your department complies in full, and never hesitate to ask for clarification where needed.

Kind regards,
