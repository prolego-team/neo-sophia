  title: 2.  Overtaking, car control and track limits
- - !section
    contents:
    - A car alone on the track may use the full
      width of the said track, however, as soon as it is  caught by a car which is
      about to lap it the driver  must allow the faster driver past at the first possible  opportunity.     If
      the driver who has been caught does not seem to  make full use of the rear-view
      mirrors, flag  marshals will display the waved blue flag to indicate  that the
      faster driver wants to overtake.  Any driver who appears to ignore the blue
      flags will  be reported to the Stewards.
    - b)  Overtaking, according to the circumstances,
      may be carried out on either the right or the left.    A driver may not leave
      the track without justifiable  reason.  More than one change of direction to
      defend a  position is not permitted.   Any driver moving back towards the racing
      line,  having earlier defended his position off-line, should  leave at least
      one car width between his own car  and the edge of the track on the approach
      to the  corner.  However, manoeuvres liable to hinder other  drivers, such as
      deliberate crowding of a car  beyond the edge of the track or any other abnormal  change
      of direction, are strictly prohibited. Any  driver who appears guilty of any
      of the above  offences will be reported to the Stewards.
    - c)  Drivers must use the track at all times and
      may not leave the track without a justifiable reason.  For the avoidance of
      doubt, the white lines defining  the track edges are considered to be part of
      the  track but the kerbs are not.    Should a car leave the track for any reason,
      the  driver may rejoin.   However, this may only be done when it is safe to  do
      so and without gaining any lasting advantage. A  driver will be judged to have
      left the track if no part  of the car remains in contact with the track.
      A driver may be reported to the Stewards should  they perform any act which
      results in debris being  brought onto the track.
    - d)  Causing a collision, repetition of serious
      mistakes or the appearance of a lack of control over  the car (such as leaving
      the track) will be reported  to the Stewards and may entail the imposition of  penalties
      up to and including the disqualification of  any driver concerned.
    - e)  It is not permitted to drive any car unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a
      manner  deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers at  any time.

  title: 3.  Cars stopping during a race
- - !section
    contents:
    - The driver of any car leaving the track because of being unable to maintain
      racing speed  should signal the intention
      to do so in good time  and is responsible for ensuring that the manoeuvre  is
      carried out safely and as near as possible to a  point of exit.
    - Should a car stop outside the pit lane, it must be  moved as soon as possible so that
      its presence  does not constitute a danger or hinder other  drivers.    If the
      driver is unable to move the car, it shall be the  duty of the marshals to assist.
      If such assistance  results in the driver rejoining the race, this must be  done
      without committing any breach of the  regulations and without gaining any advantage.
    - Repairs carried out on the track may only be made by the driver using tools and spare parts  carried aboard the car.
    - Replenishment of any kind is prohibited save when the car concerned is stopped at its pit.
    - Apart from the driver and duly appointed officials, nobody is allowed to
      touch a car except in  the pit lane. Pushing a car on the track is prohibited.

    - "The pit lane is demarcated such that the lane  closest to the pit wall is designated\
      \ the \u201Cfast lane\u201D  and the lane closest to the garages (or in some\
      \  cases the \u201Cworking wall\u201D) is designated the \u201Cinner  lane\u201D\
      \ (or \u201Cworking lane\u201D).       b) Cars in the fast lane have priority\
      \ over those re- joining from the working lane. Once a car has left  its garage\
      \ or pit stop position it should blend into  the fast lane as soon as it is\
      \ safe to do so, and  without unnecessarily impeding cars which are  already\
      \ in the fast lane.      c) A speed limit will be imposed in the pit lane and\
      \  must be respected at all times.     d) Cars in either the fast lane or working\
      \ lane may  not overtake other cars in the fast lane except in  exceptional\
      \ circumstances e.g., a slow car with an  obvious mechanical problem, a stopped\
      \ car, an  obstacle.       e) A car will be deemed to have been released  either\
      \ when it has been driven out of its designated  garage or after it has moved\
      \ from its pit stop  position."
