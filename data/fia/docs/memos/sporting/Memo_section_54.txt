Subject: Detailed Summary of FIA Regulations - Article 55 (Safety Car)

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. To ensure regulatory compliance with the FIA, a summary has been prepared of the detailed rules concerning the deployment of the safety car as per Article 55. Please familiarize yourselves with these regulations to avoid any penalties or misunderstanding.

1. FIA will deploy the safety car driven by an appointed driver and an observer, who can identify all the competing cars [55.1].

2. The safety car will position itself at the front of the grid before the pit lane opens for a reconnaissance lap and remain there until the five-minute signal is given [55.2].

3. The safety car can be brought into operation to neutralize a race only if Competitors or officials are in immediate physical danger and suspending the race is not necessary [55.3].

4. When the safety car is deployed, the message “SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED” will be sent to all Competitors to prevent dangerous driving behaviour [55.4, 55.5].

5. The safety car will join the track regardless of the leader's position with orange lights illuminated [55.6].

6. All competing cars must reduce speed and form a line behind the safety car, maintaining a gap of no more than ten car lengths [55.7].

7. Overtaking is prohibited with few exceptions as outlined in Article 55.7 a) to h) [55.8].

8. Cars that are erroneously located ahead of the leader when the safety car is deployed may be signalled to overtake the safety car [55.9].

9. The safety car will be used until the leader and all remaining cars are lined up behind it, maintaining a distance of ten car lengths [55.10].

10. Under certain conditions, the safety car and all competitors may have to use the pit lane [55.11].

11. No overtaking will be allowed if the Clerk of the Course decides the track conditions are unsuitable [55.12].

12. If safe, lapped cars will be allowed to pass lead lap cars and the safety car [55.13].

13. When it's safe to call in the safety car, the message “SAFETY CAR IN THIS LAP” will be sent to all competitors, signaling a return to normal race conditions [55.14].

14. Each lap completed under the safety car counts as a race lap [55.15].

15. If the safety car is still deployed at the beginning of the last lap, it will enter the pit lane at the end of the lap, with cars taking the end-of-session signal as normal without any overtaking [55.16].

Kindly ensure you are adhering to these regulations for the optimal performance of our team. Please reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best,
