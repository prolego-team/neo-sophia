      - The FIA will organise the FIA Formula One World Championship (the "Championship")
        which  is the property of the FIA and comprises two titles of World Champion,
        one for drivers and  one for constructors. It consists of the Formula One
        Grand Prix races which are included in  the Formula One calendar and in respect
        of which the ASNs and organisers have signed  organisation agreements with
        the FIA. All the participating parties (FIA, ASNs, organisers,  competitors
        and circuits) undertake to apply as well as observe the rules governing the  Championship
        and must hold FIA Super Licences which are issued to drivers, competitors,  officials,
        organisers and circuits.
      - The Championship and each of its Competitions are governed by the FIA in accordance
        with  the Regulations. In the sense of the Regulations, terms referring to
        natural persons are applicable to any  gender.

    - Duty of Competitor It is the duty of each Competitor to satisfy the FIA technical
      delegate and the stewards that  his Formula 1 Car complies with these regulations
      in their entirety at all times during a  Competition. The design of the car,
      its components and systems shall, with the exception of safety  features, demonstrate
      their compliance with these regulations by means of physical  inspection of
      hardware or materials. Unless explicitly requested by an Article, no mechanical  design
      may rely upon software inspection as a means of ensuring its compliance.
    - Due to their nature, the compliance of electronic systems may be assessed by
      means of  inspection of hardware, software and data.
    - CAD models may be requested by the FIA in order to check compliance with the
      Regulations.  Such models should be supplied in a format and by a method specified
      by the FIA. In such  cases, scanning technology will be used by the FIA to check
      that the physical car is the same  as the inspected CAD models.
    - "Each competitor must ensure that all relevant personnel (whether employee,\
      \ consultant,  contractor, secondee or any other type of permanent or temporary\
      \ personnel) associated  with its participation in the Championship are appropriately\
      \ informed with respect to the  ways in which their areas of responsibility\
      \ may impact the competitor\u2019s compliance with the  Regulations."
    - Each competitor must ensure that the FIA ethics and compliance hotline with
      respect to the  Regulations is clearly communicated to all these individuals.

      or closed courses that is  propelled by its own means, moving by constantly
      taking real support on the ground, of  which the propulsion and steering are
      under the direct control of a driver aboard the vehicle.  It runs on four non-aligned
      complete wheels, with wheel centres that are arranged  symmetrically about the
      car centre plane, when in the straight-ahead position, to form the  front and
      rear axles.

      - Concave and convex curvature References made in this Article on curvature
        of aerodynamic surfaces refer to the part of the  aerodynamic surface which
        is in contact with the external air stream.
      - When references are made to the curvature of a surface, without specifying
        an intersection  with a particular plane, the local curvature at any point
        will be defined as the curvature of the  intersection of the surface in question
        with a plane passing through a line normal to the  surface at that point.
        The concave radius of curvature of the surface at that point will be  defined
        as the minimum concave radius of curvature obtained when the intersecting
        plane is  swept through 180 degrees around the normal line. The convex radius
        of curvature of that  surface at that point will be defined as the minimum
        convex radius of curvature obtained  when the intersecting plane is swept
        through 180 degrees around the normal line.
      - As an example, and for the sake of clarity, the aerodynamic surface of a solid
        sphere would  be the surface where this sphere makes contact with the external
        airstream, and would be  considered to be a convex surface.

        satisfied if the  two curves or two surfaces at the intersection are tangent
        to one another and also have their  normal coincident with each other.
      - Where two adjacent surfaces are not tangent continuous but could be made so
        by applying  an edge radius of no more than 1mm along their boundary, these
        surfaces will be considered  tangent continuous at this boundary whether or
        not the edge radius is applied, as long as  such an edge radius is permitted
        according to the relevant article.

      - Fillet and Edge Radius A fillet radius is formed by rounding an internal corner
        (included angle less than 180 degrees)  with a concave surface by only adding
        material, whilst an edge radius is created by smoothing  an external corner
        (included angle greater than 180 degrees) through material removal,  resulting
        in with a convex surface by only removing material.
      - In both cases the resultant surface must be formed by arcs with radius of
        curvature  respecting the limit(s) specified, connecting two fully defined
        surfaces tangentially with no  inflection and perpendicular to the intersection
        between them. Unless otherwise specified,  both fillet and edge radii may
        change in magnitude around the periphery of the boundary  around which they
        are defined, but such changes must be continuous.
      - If there exists a discontinuity in tangency at the trailing edge of the intersection
        between the  parts to be joined by a fillet radius, then a closed aerodynamic
        fairing may be added  immediately behind the trailing edge. This fairing must
        be no larger in cross section than the  preceding fillet radius and any trailing
        edge immediately adjacent to the fillet and no longer  than three times the
        maximum fillet arc radius at this point.

        3.11.1 and the  Floor Bodywork are fully defined, the Front and Rear Bodywork
        assembly and the Floor  Bodywork must be trimmed to each other, such that
        no overlapping surfaces remain.  Additionally, before the trimming is applied,
        any Mid Chassis or Rear Bodywork remaining  below the Floor Bodywork must
        be discarded and the intersection formed by any remaining  surfaces and the
        Floor Bodywork must produce no more than one curve. A maximum fillet  radius,
        no greater than 50mm, may be applied along the intersection between these
        surfaces.  Any such fillet must be at least 1mm distant from RV-FLOOR-EDGE.
        Furthermore, once all  surfaces are trimmed and filleted, no part of the Mid
        Chassis, Rear Bodywork, fillet between  the Rear Bodywork and the Floor Bodywork,
        or fillet between the Mid Chassis and the Floor  Bodywork, may be visible
        from below.
      - Once the Front and Rear Bodywork has been assembled to the Floor Bodywork,
        up to two  apertures may be added on each side of the car for the sole purpose
        of giving tyre  temperature sensors visibility of the tyres, one for the front
        tyre and one for the rear tyre. If  present, each individual aperture must
        have an area no greater than 1500mm2 when  measured on the assembled, untrimmed,
        surface.

      - Front Floor Flexibility Bodywork flexibility will be tested by applying a
        load vertically upwards using a 50mm  diameter pad with a gimbled interface
        to the loadcell. The position of the centre of the pad  will be given by the
        FIA and will be on the underside of the plank within a quadrilateral area,  with
        vertices at points [XF=460, 50], [XF=610, 65], [XF=610, -65], [XF=460, -50].
        The deflection  will be measured along the loading axis.
      - 'At all times during the test, the load at a given deflection must exceed
        the load given by a  straight-line graph defined by connecting the following
        coordinates in order: (0 mm, 0 N) (1  mm, 0 N) (5 mm, 4000N) (25mm, 6000N).
        This must be the case whether the deflection is  increasing, decreasing, or
        held constant. The test will have no more than a maximum load of  8000N or
        a maximum deflection of 15mm (whichever is reached first) unless specifically  requested
        by the FIA to investigate behaviour above these limits.'
      - The load deflection relationship must be strictly monotonic with both increasing
        and  decreasing deflection.

          designed to permit greater levels of outboard floor flexibility  in untested
          regions of the floor.

        fail without compromising the  integrity of the fuel bladder. For this assessment,
        the pull-out load for any fitting will be  calculated from the clamp area
        between the fitting and the bladder (on one face of the  bladder). Between
        a clamp area of 1650mm2 and 9 500mm2, the load will be a linear  interpolation
        between points (1650mm2, 11kN) and (9 500mm2, 37.5kN). Below a clamp area  of
        1650mm2, the load will be taken as 11kN. Above a clamp area of 9 500mm2, the
        load will  be taken as 37.5kN. No fitting may have a clamp area of less than
        600 mm2.

      - Tyre specification Tyre specifications will be determined by the tyre supplier,
        in agreement with the FIA, no  later than 1 September of the previous season
        for the construction and 15 December for the  range of compounds to be used
        during the Championship season. Once determined in this  way, the specification
        of the tyres will not be changed without the agreement of the Formula  One
        Commission. Notwithstanding the above, the FIA may decide to change the specification
        during the  Championship season for safety reasons without notice or delay.

          load (168kN) when  fitted with the secondary structure as specified in Article
          12.4.2 and with the  deformation simulated as elastic. The methodology for
          the calculations shall be authenticated with data from the physical  test
          prescribed above for the load range from 0kN to 50kN. The load and displacement  shall
          be recorded along the axis of load application together with the lateral  displacement
          of the three attachments.
        - During the test, the survival cell should be fixed at its rear bulkhead
          via its engine mounts to a  strongwall and supported along its lower face
          by a surface plate.
        - The survival cell may be restrained laterally and vertically at its front
          end by a cradle that  wraps around all four sides of the survival cell.
          This cradle may extend as far forward as the  plane A-A, but may not extend
          further rearwards than XA=600. The side of the survival cell that is opposite
          to the application point of the Halo test load may  be restrained laterally
          by supports that conform to the sides of the survival cell. These lateral  supports
          may not extend further forward than XC= -1075 or above Z=545.
        - A drawing of the method of support is given in the Appendix to the Technical

      - The function of an engine oil is to lubricate moving parts, to improve the
        overall efficiency of  the engine by reducing friction and to reduce wear.
        It also cleans, inhibits corrosion, improves  sealing, and cools the engine
        by carrying heat away from moving parts. Engine oils should not  enhance the
        properties of the fuel nor energize the combustion. The presence of any  component
        that cannot be rationally associated with the defined functions of the engine
        oil  will be deemed unacceptable.

    - Oxygenates  Organic compounds containing oxygen. Advanced Sustainable component
      An advanced sustainable component is either a second  generation bio component
      or a component produced from  non-bio carbon capture and re-use. Capture and
      re-use  process must be approved by FIA. For the purposes of  quantification,
      the advanced sustainable component  contribution of a given molecule is defined
      as the carbon,  hydrogen and oxygen atoms from an advanced sustainable  origin
      as a percent of the total molecule, on a mass/mass  basis. 2023 Formula 1 Technical
      Regulations  126  31 August 2023
    - Second generation bio components
    - Second generation bio components are components  manufactured from various types
      of non-food biomass,  including lignocellulosic biomass, algae, agricultural
      residues  or waste and dedicated non-food energy crops grown on  marginal land
      unsuitable for food production. Biocomponents  from food crops can be regarded
      as second generation only if  they have already fulfilled their food purpose
      (e.g. waste  vegetable oil because it has already been used and is no  longer
      fit for human consumption). It includes all  biocomponents falling into the
      RED II definition1. Metals
    - Metals are defined as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals,  transition metals,
      actinides, lanthanides, post-transition  metals and metalloids.
    - Alkali Metals  Group 1 elements, excluding hydrogen. 1 ANNEX IX - Part A. of
      Directive(EU) 2018/2001

        any issues of compatibility, reliability or safety in respect of a SSC. This

        and reliability while at all  times having due regard to cost and performance
        implications. In consultation with the  relevant SSC supplier, the FIA will
        consider in good faith all issues raised (and modifications  proposed) during
        the consultation process, and shall determine in its sole discretion whether  or
        not to take any action. In exceptional circumstances, where a Competitor establishes
        that  a SSC is critically incompatible, unreliable or unsafe, the FIA may,
        at its sole discretion,  authorise such Competitor to carry out modifications
        to the SSC in question or use an  alternative component in order to resolve

        or usage of an alternative component will be  communicated to all Competitors,

        new specification that resolves the reliability, compatibility or safety concern.
        In  accordance with the severity of the reliability, compatibility or safety
        concern, the FIA may  authorise a phased introduction of the modified SSC.
        In such cases, after consultation with  Competitors and with the Supplier,
        the FIA will define the period of the phase-in, and any  measures that need
        to be taken to ensure that no performance advantage (e.g., mass) is  obtained
        by using either the old or the new specification of the SSC.
