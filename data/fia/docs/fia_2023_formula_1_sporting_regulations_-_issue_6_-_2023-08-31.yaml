- - !section
    contents:
    - The driver must drive the car alone and unaided. Drivers must observe the provisions
      of the Code relating to driving behaviour on circuits at all  times. Drivers
      must make every reasonable effort to use the track at all times and may not
      leave the  track without a justifiable reason. Drivers will be judged to have
      left the track if no part of the car remains in contact with it and,  for the
      avoidance of doubt, any white lines defining the track edges are considered
      to be part of  the track but the kerbs are not.
    - Should a car leave the track the driver may re-join, however, this may only
      be done when it is  safe to do so and without gaining any lasting advantage.
      At the absolute discretion of the Race  Director a driver may be given the opportunity
      to give back the whole of any advantage he  gained by leaving the track.
    - At no time may a car be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner
      which could be  deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person.

    - Any work not listed in Article 40.2 may only be undertaken with the approval

      It must be clear that  any replacement part a Competitor wishes to fit is the
      same in design and similar in mass,  inertia and function to the original. Exceptionally,
      at a Competition where a sprint session is  scheduled, replacement parts that
      are different in design will be permitted provided that the  part is of a specification
      that has been used previously in a qualifying session or a race. In such  cases,
      the Competitor should inform the FIA prior to the start of the sprint session
      of any part  where this may be necessary. Any parts which are removed shall
      be retained by the FIA.
    - If a Competitor is granted permission to change a survival cell, any of the
      additional  components detailed in Article 27.2 may also be changed provided
      that the spare survival cell  was already fitted with these additional components
      at the time of the request.
    - If a Competitor wishes to change a part during the qualifying session, sprint
      shootout, on the  grid before the start of the sprint session and between reconnaissance
      laps and / or on the  grid before the start of the race, this may be done without
      first seeking the permission of the  Technical Delegate, provided it is reasonable
      for the relevant Competitor to believe  permission would be given if there was
      time to ask and the broken or damaged part remains  in full view of the scrutineer
      assigned to the car at all times.
