Subject: Compliance with Full Year and Interim Reporting Requirements

Dear Team,

Our commitment to staying within the regulations dictates that we need to adhere to the Full Year and Interim Reporting requirements as stated by the FIA. For clarity, I am summarizing the key points related to these requirements.

1. Full Year Reporting [5.1]

   On or before the Full Year Reporting Deadline, we are to provide the Cost Cap Administration with a package of documents that constitute the Full Year Reporting Documentation. The documentation must include:

   a) The Reporting Group Documentation [5.1 (a)]

   b) The Full Year Financial Reporting Documentation [5.1 (b)]

   c) The Declarations [5.1 (c)]

   d) An accuracy and completeness assessment report from the Independent Audit Firm that signs our Audited Annual Financial Statements, formatted as dictated by the Cost Cap Administration [5.1 (d)]

   e) If we opt to perform a downward Adjustment under Article 4.1(m), we must also include a Findings Report in accordance with the requirements laid out in Article 4.1(m) [5.1 (e)]

2. Interim Reporting [5.2]

   Also, we are tasked with preparing the Interim Reporting Documentation to submit to the Cost Cap Administration by the Interim Reporting Deadline. This includes:

   a) The Reporting Group Documentation [5.2 (a)]

   b) The Interim Financial Reporting Documentation [5.2 (b)]

   c) The Declarations [5.2 (c)]

Please note, it's essential to submit these documents before the deadlines mentioned to avoid sanctions. Let's stay abreast of all these requirements and ensure full compliance for our team's success and integrity.
