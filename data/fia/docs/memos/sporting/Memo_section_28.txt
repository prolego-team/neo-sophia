SUBJECT: Compliance with FIA Power Unit Usage Regulations

Dear Team,

As part of our efforts to ensure we remain in compliance with the FIA's regulations, I want to draw your attention to the following key points regarding power unit usage as stated in the regulations. Kindly review and adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Only power units compliant with the latest submitted and approved homologation dossier, as defined in Appendix 4 of the Technical Regulations, should be used in Championships for the seasons 2022-2025 [28.1].

2. Our drivers are allowed a certain number of each item within a Championship: four (4) engines (ICE), four (4) motor generator units-heat (MGU-H), four (4) turbochargers (TC), two (2) energy stores (ES), two (2) control electronics (CE), four (4) motor generator units-kinetic (MGU-K) and eight (8) of each engine exhaust system elements [28.2].

3. If any driver uses more Power Unit elements than prescribed, a grid place penalty will be imposed on them [28.3]. The first such instance in a Championship will result in a ten (10) grid place penalty, and five (5) grid place penalties for each subsequent instance.

4. In the event of a driver replacement during a Championship, the replacement driver should abide by the original driver's power unit usage counts [28.4].

5. To ensure the integrity of the power units, the FIA will apply seals to each of the pertinent pieces before their first time use in a Competition. The team should not remove or replace these seals unless under the supervision of FIA [28.5].

This is just a summary of the regulations, please refer to the complete FIA regulations specific to the power unit usage for deeper understanding.

Our compliance with these regulations is not only a matter of integrity, but also crucial to our continued participation in Championships. Please, adhere to them and promptly report any concerns.
