SUBJECT: Amendments to the FIA Financial Regulations for Full Year Reporting Period Ending 31 December 2024 Onward

Dear Team,

Keeping our commitment to staying updated and compliant with the FIA regulations, I would like to share with you the amendments applicable to the financial reporting period ending 31st December 2024, and subsequent full-year reporting periods as detailed in the FIA's latest guidelines under Article 11.

1. Reporting Group Composition: The F1 Team's Reporting Group should comprise the F1 Team, along with any additional entities within the F1 Team's Legal Group Structure that are determined in line with the FIA's standards, where the F1 Team has incurred less than 98% of the costs of the F1 Activities during the Reporting Period [2.5].

2. Addition of Entities: Added entities within the Reporting Group should be the ones incurring the greatest among the costs of the F1 Activities. Entities will be added in a decreasing order of costs incurred, up until the entities within the Reporting Group account for 98% or more of the costs [2.6].

3. Cost Calculation: Costs of F1 Activities should be calculated excluding costs within the scope of Articles 3.1(a), 3.1(f), 3.1(j), and 3.1(o). Any amounts recharged within the F1 Team's Legal Group Structure in connection to the F1 Activities should also be adjusted out [2.8].

4. Reporting Group Exclusivity: An entity cannot be part of the Reporting Group for more than one F1 Team. In case of overlap, the entity will be included in the one where it incurs the greatest amount of costs, excluding costs within the scope of Articles 3.1(a), 3.1(f), 3.1(j), and 3.1(o) [2.9].

5. Relevant Cost Calculation: Costs excluded from the Reporting Group but incurred by entities within the F1 Team's Legal Group can either be recharged at Fair Value to a Reporting Group Entity or included in Relevant Costs at Fair Value via an Adjustment to the Total Costs. Costs within the scope of Articles 3.1(a), 3.1(f), 3.1(j), and 3.1(o) are excluded [2.10].

Please take note of these changes and also share this information with members of your units to ensure we remain compliant with the updated FIA Financial Regulations. Feel free to reach out if there are any questions or if further clarification is needed.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
