Subject: Compliance with FIA Regulations - Exclusion of Costs

Dear Team,

This memo is written with intention to clarify and summarize the FIA's Financial Regulations as set out in Article 3 regarding exclusions in cost reporting. It is important that we correctly identify and exclude certain cost categories as defined by the FIA.

Here is a summary of key categories of costs considered as Excluded Costs under FIA Regulations:

1. All costs directly related to Marketing Activities are excluded [3.1(a)].
2. Costs provided to F1 Drivers, or their Connected Party, for services, along with all related travel and accommodation costs incurred for drivers are excluded [3.1(b,c)].
3. Costs provided to the three individuals with the highest aggregate amount of Consideration; including travel, accommodation, and associated employerâ€™s social security contributions are excluded from the cost cap [3.1(d)].
4. All costs related to any Heritage Asset Activities are excluded [3.1(e)(i)-(ii)].
5. All financial costs and Corporate Income Tax are excluded [3.1(f,g)].
6. Costs directly attributable to Non-F1 Activities [3.1(h)(i)-(ii)] and costs related to activities such as Human Resources, Finance or Legal are excluded [3.1(i)] .

8. Financial penalties related to the breach of Financial Regulations are excluded [3.1(m)].

10. Amounts related to depreciation, exchange gains and losses, and more are excluded [3.1(o,p)].
11. Travel costs connected to a Competition or Testing of Current Cars by Personnel are excluded [3.1(r)].

14. Employee Termination Benefits in the period ending on December 2021 and 2022 [3.1(x)] and all costs linked to Sustainability Initiatives are excluded [3.1(y)].
15. If a cost is attributable to a combination of activities such as Marketing, Heritage Asset Activities, Non-F1 Activities, HR, Finance, and Legal Activities, that cost is also an Excluded Cost [3.2].
16. For teams who do not use US Dollars as their Presentation Currency, amounts will be converted according to the Initial Applicable Rate [3.3].

Compliance with the above exclusions is mandatory and vital in accurately reflecting our expenditure in line with FIA financial regulations.
